{"id":283117669,"title":"Bayesian Nonparametric Density Estimation under Length Bias","authors":["Spyridon J. Hatjispyros","Theodoros Nicoleris","Stephen G. Walker"],"_abstract":"A density estimation method in a Bayesian nonparametric framework is presented when recorded data are not coming directly from the distribution of interest, but from a length biased version. From a Bayesian perspective, efforts to computationally evaluate posterior quantities conditionally on length biased data were hindered by the inability to circumvent the problem of a normalizing constant. In this paper we present a novel Bayesian nonparametric approach to the length bias sampling problem which circumvents the issue of the normalizing constant. Numerical illustrations as well as a real data example are presented and the estimator is compared against its frequentist counterpart, the kernel density estimator for indirect data of Jones (1991).","cited_in":[],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221618348_The_Gaussian_Process_Density_Sampler","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4745571_Length-Biased_Sampling_With_Right_Censoring_An_Unconditional_Approach","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254287145_Poisson_Overdispersion_Estimates_Based_on_the_Method_of_Asymmetric_Maximum_Likelihood","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2741222_Bayesian_Density_Estimation_and_Inference_Using_Mixtures","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38357634_A_Bayesian_Analysis_of_Some_Non-Parametric_Problems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/31102890_Kernel_density_estimation_for_length_biased_data_Biometrika_78511-520","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220286498_Slice_sampling_mixture_models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5106122_On_Consistency_of_Nonparametric_Normal_Mixtures_for_Bayesian_Density_Estimation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38359078_On_a_Class_of_Bayesian_Nonparametric_Estimates_I_Density_Estimates","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228092010_MCMC_for_doubly-intractable_distributions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268659636_Ranked_Set_Sampling_with_Size-Biased_Probability_of_Selection","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265332516_Weighted_Distributions_and_Size-Biased_Sampling_with_Applications_to_Wildlife_Populations_and_Human_Families","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229100417_A_Constructive_Definition_of_the_Dirichlet_Prior","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224817413_A_Reliable_Data-Based_Bandwidth_Selection_Method_for_Kernel_Density_Estimation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228737569_Towards_a_Faster_Implementation_of_Density_Estimation_With_Logistic_Gaussian_Process_Priors","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38358847_Nonparametric_Estimation_in_the_Presence_of_Length_Bias","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46451640_Sampling_the_Dirichlet_Mixture_Model_with_Slices","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220504969_Posterior_Sampling_When_the_Normalizing_Constant_is_Unknown"]}
