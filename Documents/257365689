{"id":257365689,"title":"Data Integration for Classification Problems Employing Gaussian Process Priors (The full paper with accompanying material for the derivations for EP)","authors":["Mark Girolami","Mingjun Zhong"],"_abstract":"By adopting Gaussian process priors a fully Bayesian solution to the problem of integrating possibly heterogeneous data sets within a classification setting is presented. Approximate inference schemes employing Variational & Expectation Propagation based methods are developed and rigorously assessed. We demonstrate our approach to integrating multiple data sets on a large scale protein fold prediction problem where we infer the optimal combinations of covariance functions and achieve state-of-the-art performance without resorting to any ad hoc parameter tuning and classifier combination.","cited_in":[],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3192933_Bayesian_classification_with_Gaussian_processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11355585_Learning_Gene_Functional_Classifications_from_Multiple_Data_Types","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7108915_Ensemble_classifier_for_protein_fold_recognition","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12033613_Multi-class_Protein_Fold_Recognition_Using_Support_Vector_Machines_and_Neural_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8574695_A_Statistical_Framework_for_Genomic_Data_Fusion","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41781429_Assessing_Approximate_Inference_for_Binary_Gaussian_Process_Classification","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239666344_Regression_and_Classification_Using_Gaussian_Process_Priors","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220499817_Variational_Bayesian_Multinomial_Probit_Regression_with_Gaussian_Process_Priors","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7782794_Kernel_Methods_for_Predicting_Protein-Protein_Interactions"]}
