{"id":221667869,"title":"Inference in Hidden Markov Models with Explicit State Duration Distributions","authors":["Michael Dewar","Chris Wiggins","Frank Wood"],"_abstract":"In this letter we borrow from the inference techniques developed for unbounded state-cardinality (nonparametric) variants of the HMM and use them to develop a tuning-parameter free, black-box inference procedure for Explicit-state-duration hidden Markov models (EDHMM). EDHMMs are HMMs that have latent states consisting of both discrete state-indicator and discrete state-duration random variables. In contrast to the implicit geometric state duration distribution possessed by the standard HMM, EDHMMs allow the direct parameterisation and estimation of per-state duration distributions. As most duration distributions are defined over the positive integers, truncation or other approximations are usually required to perform EDHMM inference.","cited_in":[{"id":263582646,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263582646_Infinite_Structured_Hidden_Semi-Markov_Models"},{"id":265545123,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265545123_EXPLICIT_DURATION_HIDDEN_MARKOV_MODELS_FOR_MULTIPLE-INSTRUMENT_POLYPHONIC_MUSIC_TRANSCRIPTION"},{"id":267034770,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267034770_Generalized_Species_Sampling_Priors_With_Latent_Beta_Reinforcements"},{"id":257665466,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257665466_MCMC_implementation_for_Bayesian_hidden_semi-Markov_models_with_illustrative_applications"},{"id":283439283,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283439283_Species_Sampling_Priors_for_Modeling_Dependence_An_Application_to_the_Detection_of_Chromosomal_Aberrations"},{"id":275050127,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275050127_Estimating_Latent_Attentional_States_Based_on_Simultaneous_Binary_and_Continuous_Behavioral_Measures"},{"id":282710442,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282710442_Duration_High-Order_Hidden_Markov_Models_and_Training_Algorithms_for_Speech_Recognition"},{"id":289991467,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289991467_Model-based_Behavioral_Causality_Analysis_of_Handball_with_Delayed_Transfer_Entropy"}],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/32896369_Hierarchical_Dirichlet_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/31483685_A_Hidden_Semi-Markov_Model-Based_Speech_Synthesis_System","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220325770_Practical_implementation_of_an_efficient_forward-backward_algorithm_for_an_explicit_duration_Hidden_Markov_model","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224881743_The_Infinite_Hidden_Markov_Model","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265369049_Slice_sampling_With_discussions_and_rejoinder","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3342828_An_efficient_forward-backward_algorithm_for_an_explicit-duration_hidden_Markov_model","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221344933_An_HDP-HMM_for_systems_with_state_persistence","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220546952_Hidden_semi-Markov_models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4742259_Hierarchical_Dirichlet_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221995544_Bishop_CM_Pattern_Recognition_and_Machine_Learning_Springer","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221345210_Beam_sampling_for_the_infinite_hidden_Markov_model","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51887319_Unified_Treatment_of_Hidden_Markov_Switching_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3333469_From_HMM's_to_Segment_Models_A_Unified_View_of_Stochastic_Modeling_for_Speech_Recognition","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2984124_Rabiner_L_A_Tutorial_on_Hidden_Markov_Models_and_Selected_Applications_in_Speech_Recognition_Proc_IEEE_772_257-286","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24396356_A_Bayesian_Framework_for_Word_Segmentation_Exploring_the_Effects_of_Context","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240338881_The_Theory_of_Segmental_Hidden_Markov_Models"]}
