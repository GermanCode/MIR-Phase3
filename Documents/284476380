{"id":284476380,"title":"Variational Auto-encoded Deep Gaussian Processes","authors":["Zhenwen Dai","Andreas Damianou","Javier Gonz√°lez","Neil Lawrence"],"_abstract":"ABSTRACT We develop a scalable deep non-parametric generative model by augmenting deep Gaussian processes with a recognition model. Inference is performed in a novel scalable variational framework where the variational posterior distributions are reparametrized through a multilayer perceptron. The key aspect of this reformulation is that it prevents the proliferation of variational parameters which otherwise grow linearly in proportion to the sample size. We derive a new formulation of the variational lower bound that allows us to distribute most of the computation in a way that enables to handle datasets of the size of mainstream deep learning tasks. We show the efficacy of the method on a variety of challenges including deep unsupervised learning and deep Bayesian optimization.","cited_in":[],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283761858_Training_Deep_Gaussian_Processes_using_Stochastic_Expectation_Propagation_and_Probabilistic_Backpropagation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283296556_Deep_Gaussian_Processes_and_Variational_Propagation_of_Uncertainty","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278775039_Additive_Kernels_for_Gaussian_Process_Modeling","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320835_Multiple_Kernel_Learning_Algorithms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225237917_Efficient_Global_Optimization_of_Expensive_Black-Box_Functions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2985446_Gradient-based_learning_applied_to_document_recognition_Proc_IEEE","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267375494_Bayesian_Gaussian_Processes_for_Sequential_Prediction_Optimisation_and_Quadrature","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41781188_Warped_Gaussian_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225307589_Practical_Bayesian_Optimization_of_Machine_Learning_Algorithms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257410088_A_Deep_and_Tractable_Density_Estimator","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260340510_Avoiding_pathologies_in_very_deep_networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320635_Bayesian_Gaussian_Process_Latent_Variable_Model","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269116839_Nested_Variational_Compression_in_Deep_Gaussian_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228102719_Improving_neural_networks_by_preventing_co-adaptation_of_feature_detectors_arXiv_preprint_arXiv12070580","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232805135_Deep_Gaussian_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277958985_Variational_Dropout_and_the_Local_Reparameterization_Trick","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221345535_Hierarchical_Gaussian_process_latent_variable_models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256071692_Hierarchical_Bayesian_modelling_of_gene_expression_time_series_across_irregularly_sampled_replicates_and_clusters","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281486855_Semi-described_and_semi-supervised_learning_with_Gaussian_processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260022128_Neural_Variational_Inference_and_Learning_in_Belief_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267157313_Gaussian_Process_Models_with_Parallelization_and_GPU_acceleration","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235638891_Gaussian_Process_Covariance_Kernels_for_Pattern_Discovery_andExtrapolation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221345335_Local_distance_preservation_in_the_GP-LVM_through_back_constraints","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262991675_Stochastic_Backpropagation_and_Approximate_Inference_in_Deep_Generative_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260340965_Manifold_Gaussian_Processes_for_Regression","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235656799_Structure_Discovery_in_Nonparametric_Regression_through_Compositional_Kernel_Search","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260089482_Distributed_Variational_Inference_in_Sparse_Gaussian_Process_Regression_and_Latent_Variable_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229157977_Better_Mixing_via_Deep_Representations","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51918516_Variational_Gaussian_Process_Dynamical_Systems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233639789_Modelling_creep_rupture_strength_of_ferritic_steel_welds","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237053970_Deep_Generative_Stochastic_Networks_Trainable_by_Backprop","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259400035_Auto-Encoding_Variational_Bayes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272195054_Generative_Moment_Matching_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277959098_Dropout_as_a_Bayesian_Approximation_Representing_Model_Uncertainty_in_Deep_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277022910_Weight_Uncertainty_in_Neural_Networks"]}
