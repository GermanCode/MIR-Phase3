{"id":266225209,"title":"Large Scale Distributed Deep Networks","authors":["Jeffrey Dean","G.s. Corrado","Rajat Monga","Kai Chen","Matthieu Devin","Quoc V Le"],"_abstract":"Recent work in unsupervised feature learning and deep learning has shown that be-ing able to train large models can dramatically improve performance. In this paper, we consider the problem of training a deep network with billions of parameters using tens of thousands of CPU cores. We have developed a software framework called DistBelief that can utilize computing clusters with thousands of machines to train large models. Within this framework, we have developed two algorithms for large-scale distributed training: (i) Downpour SGD, an asynchronous stochastic gradient descent procedure supporting a large number of model replicas, and (ii) Sandblaster, a framework that supports a variety of distributed batch optimization procedures, including a distributed implementation of L-BFGS. Downpour SGD and Sandblaster L-BFGS both increase the scale and speed of deep network train-ing. We have successfully used our system to train a deep network 30x larger than previously reported in the literature, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet, a visual object recognition task with 16 million images and 21k cate-gories. We show that these same techniques dramatically accelerate the training of a more modestly-sized deep network for a commercial speech recognition ser-vice. Although we focus on and report performance of these methods as applied to training large neural networks, the underlying algorithms are applicable to any gradient-based machine learning algorithm.","cited_in":[{"id":286513299,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286513299_Speeding_Up_Distributed_Machine_Learning_Using_Codes"},{"id":284476391,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284476391_Trivializing_The_Energy_Landscape_Of_Deep_Networks"},{"id":280497992,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280497992_Perturbed_Iterate_Analysis_for_Asynchronous_Stochastic_Optimization"},{"id":278390733,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278390733_Optimizing_Network_Performance_in_Distributed_Machine_Learning"},{"id":272194245,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272194245_Convergence_of_gradient_based_pre-training_in_Denoising_autoencoders"},{"id":283677440,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283677440_A-SDLM_An_Asynchronous_Stochastic_Learning_Algorithm_For_Fast_Distributed_Learning"},{"id":267627408,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267627408_High-Performance_Distributed_ML_at_Scale_through_Parameter_Server_Consistency_Models"},{"id":265908573,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265908573_Large_Scale_Distributed_Multiclass_Logistic_Regression"},{"id":263545400,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263545400_Exponentially_Increasing_the_Capacity-to-Computation_Ratio_for_Conditional_Computation_in_Deep_Learning"},{"id":261439613,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261439613_Exploring_the_power_of_GPU's_for_training_Deep_Belief_Networks"},{"id":259483161,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259483161_Petuum_A_Framework_for_Iterative-Convergent_Distributed_ML"},{"id":236654800,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236654800_Deep_Unsupervised_Learning_on_a_Desktop_PC_A_Primer_for_Cognitive_Scientists"},{"id":261150981,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261150981_Tracking_with_deep_neural_networks"},{"id":261159435,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261159435_On_rectified_linear_units_for_speech_processing"},{"id":261308856,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261308856_Multiframe_deep_neural_networks_for_acoustic_modeling"},{"id":281555645,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281555645_Speed_Up_of_Recurrent_Neural_Network_Language_Models_With_Sentence_Independent_Subsampling_Stochastic_Gradient_Descent"},{"id":239524463,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239524463_Parallel_Coordinate_Descent_Newton_for_Efficient_L1-Regularized_Minimization"},{"id":262398078,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262398078_HMM-based_script_identification_for_OCR"},{"id":261153444,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261153444_Multilingual_acoustic_models_using_distributed_deep_neural_networks"},{"id":261526842,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261526842_Deep_neural_networks_with_auxiliary_Gaussian_mixture_models_for_real-time_speech_recognition"},{"id":269310981,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269310981_Energy_efficient_neural_networks_for_big_data_analytics"},{"id":260062490,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260062490_Long_Short-Term_Memory_Based_Recurrent_Neural_Network_Architectures_for_Large_Vocabulary_Speech_Recognition"},{"id":260107539,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260107539_Dictionary_Learning_Over_Distributed_Models"},{"id":260609805,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260609805_Computational_neuroscience_Beyond_the_local_circuit"},{"id":268191844,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268191844_Improving_deep_neural_network_acoustic_models_using_generalized_maxout_networks"},{"id":262248669,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262248669_Autoamtic_Language_Identification_Using_Deep_Neural_Networks"},{"id":286235572,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286235572_Handwritten_Character_Recognition_by_Alternately_Trained_Relaxation_Convolutional_Neural_Network"},{"id":265470520,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265470520_Frame_by_frame_language_identification_in_short_utterances_using_deep_neural_networks"},{"id":265687460,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265687460_Transfer_Learning_for_Video_Recognition_with_Scarce_Training_Data"},{"id":265787949,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265787949_Going_Deeper_with_Convolutions"},{"id":266082888,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266082888_Deep_Architecture_for_Traffic_Flow_Prediction_Deep_Belief_Networks_With_Multitask_Learning"},{"id":264674341,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264674341_A_Tensor-Based_Deep_Learning_Framework"},{"id":268227183,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268227183_Statistically_Significant_Detection_of_Linguistic_Change"},{"id":281701143,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281701143_Fast_Learning_of_Deep_Neural_Networks_via_Singular_Value_Decomposition"},{"id":290182092,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/290182092_Acoustic_models
