{"id":228095688,"title":"Flexible Modeling of Latent Task Structures in Multitask Learning","authors":["Alexandre Passos","Piyush Rai","Jacques Wainer","Hal Daume III"],"_abstract":"ABSTRACT Multitask learning algorithms are typically designed assuming some fixed, a priori known latent structure shared by all the tasks. However, it is usually unclear what type of latent task structure is the most appropriate for a given multitask learning problem. Ideally, the \"right\" latent task structure should be learned in a data-driven manner. We present a flexible, nonparametric Bayesian model that posits a mixture of factor analyzers structure on the tasks. The nonparametric aspect makes the model expressive enough to subsume many existing models of latent task structures (e.g, mean-regularized tasks, clustered tasks, low-rank or linear/non-linear subspace assumption on tasks, etc.). Moreover, it can also learn more general task structures, addressing the shortcomings of such models. We present a variational inference algorithm for our model. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets, on both regression and classification problems, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","cited_in":[{"id":273770572,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273770572_Extracting_Low-Dimensional_Control_Variables_for_Movement_Primitives"},{"id":269997485,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269997485_A_Unified_Perspective_on_Multi-Domain_and_Multi-Task_Learning"},{"id":234083373,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234083373_Domain_Generalization_via_Invariant_Feature_Representation"},{"id":290818928,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/290818928_Using_Both_Latent_and_Supervised_Shared_Topics_for_Multitask_Learning"},{"id":288203703,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/288203703_On_multiplicative_multitask_feature_learning"}],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220699313_An_Algorithm_for_Transfer_Learning_in_a_Heterogeneous_Environment","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2239690_Variational_Inference_for_Bayesian_Mixtures_of_Factor_Analysers","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320877_Variational_Inference_for_the_Indian_Buffet_Process","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221344864_Modeling_Transfer_Learning_in_Human_Categorization_with_the_Hierarchical_Dirichlet_Process","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254212736_Variational_inference_for_Dirichlet_process_mixtures_Bayesian_Anal_1121-144","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220319924_A_Framework_for_Learning_Predictive_Structures_from_Multiple_Tasks_and_Unlabeled_Data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/27290603_Gibbs_Sampling_Methods_for_Stick_-_breaking_Priors","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220325787_Corrections_to_Compressive_Sensing_on_Manifolds_Using_a_Nonparametric_Mixture_of_Factor_Analyzers_Algorithm_and_Performance_Bounds_Dec_10_6140-6155","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222819870_Adaptation_of_maximum_entropy_capitalizer_Little_data_can_help_a_lot","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221618095_Multi-task_Gaussian_Process_Prediction","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5614024_Bias_learning_knowledge_sharing","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38357634_A_Bayesian_Analysis_of_Some_Non-Parametric_Problems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221617871_Multi-Task_Feature_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2365311_A_variational_approach_to_Bayesian_logistic_regression_models_and_their_extensions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221618939_Learning_Multiple_Tasks_using_Manifold_Regularization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3319912_K-SVD_An_Algorithm_for_Designing_Overcomplete_Dictionaries_for_Sparse_Representation_IEEE_Trans_Signal_Processing_54_4311-4322","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221345667_Learning_with_Whom_to_Share_in_Multi-task_Feature_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220270203_Infinite_Latent_Feature_Models_and_the_Indian_Buffet_Process","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220319876_Multi-Task_Learning_for_Classification_with_Dirichlet_Process_Priors","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320770_Multi-task_Learning_for_Recommender_System"]}
