{"id":4219163,"title":"Smile and laughter recognition using speech processing and face recognition from conversation video","authors":["Akinori Ito","Xinyue Wang","M Suzuki","Shozo Makino"],"_abstract":"This paper describes a method to detect smiles and laughter sounds from the video of natural dialogue. A smile is the most common facial expression observed in a dialogue. Detecting a user's smiles and laughter sounds can be useful for estimating the mental state of the user of a spoken-dialogue-based user interface. In addition, detecting laughter sound can be utilized to prevent the speech recognizer from wrongly recognizing the laughter sound as meaningful words. In this paper, a method to detect smile expression and laughter sound robustly by combining an image-based facial expression recognition method and an audio-based laughter sound recognition method. The image-based method uses a feature vector based on feature point detection from face images. The method could detect smile faces by more than 80% recall and precision rate. A method to combine a GMM-based laughter sound recognizer and the image-based method could improve the accuracy of detection of laughter sounds compared with methods that use image or sound only. As a result, more than 70% recall and precision rate of laughter sound detection was obtained from the natural conversation videos.","cited_in":[{"id":261264862,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261264862_Audiovisual_Detection_of_Laughter_in_Human-Machine_Interaction"},{"id":269108074,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269108074_Random_Forests_for_Laughter_Detection"},{"id":224929669,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224929669_Audiovisual_Vocal_Outburst_Classification_in_Noisy_Acoustic_Conditions"},{"id":51501156,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51501156_Smile_detection_by_boosting_pixel_differences"},{"id":224246552,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224246552_Audiovisual_classification_of_vocal_outbursts_in_human_conversation_using_Long-Short-Term_Memory_networks"},{"id":221406305,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221406305_Detecting_Attempts_at_Humor_in_Multiparty_Meetings"},{"id":221052334,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221052334_Recognizing_communicative_facial_expressions_for_discovering_interpersonal_emotions_in_group_meetings"},{"id":221040350,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221040350_Decision-Level_Fusion_for_Audio-Visual_Laughter_Detection"},{"id":224313060,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224313060_Audiovisual_discrimination_between_laughter_and_speech"},{"id":221368673,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221368673_Fusion_of_audio_and_visual_cues_for_laughter_detection"},{"id":254217766,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254217766_Taxonomy_of_Behavioural_Biometrics"},{"id":250064716,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/250064716_Fusion_for_Audio-Visual_Laughter_Detection"},{"id":41387083,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41387083_Social_Signal_Processing_State-of-the-Art_and_Future_Perspectives_of_an_Emerging_Domain"},{"id":221052199,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221052199_Audiovisual_Laughter_Detection_Based_on_Temporal_Features"},{"id":247836093,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247836093_Behavioural_biometrics_a_survey_and_classification_Int_J_Biometrics"},{"id":224323460,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224323460_A_detection_method_of_lip-smack_in_spontaneous_speech"},{"id":225514101,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225514101_Smile_Detection_for_User_Interfaces"},{"id":220716654,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220716654_A_Study_for_the_Self_Similarity_Smile_Detection"},{"id":254859818,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254859818_How_does_real_affect_affect_affect_recognition_in_speech"},{"id":235779351,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235779351_Spotting_Agreement_and_Disagreement_A_Survey_of_Nonverbal_Audiovisual_Cues_and_Tools"},{"id":222430190,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222430190_Social_Signal_Processing_Survey_of_an_Emerging_Domain"},{"id":220029422,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220029422_Facial_feature_detection_and_tracking_in_a_new_multimodal_technology-enhanced_learning_environment_for_social_communication"},{"id":224205201,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224205201_Pervasive_Social_Computing_Augmenting_Five_Facets_of_Human_Intelligence"},{"id":221292666,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221292666_An_efficient_approach_to_smile_detection"},{"id":279242822,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279242822_Spectral_Stability_Feature_Based_Novel_Method_for_Discriminating_Speech_and_Laughter"},{"id":224207538,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224207538_Audiovisual_Discrimination_Between_Speech_and_Laughter_Why_and_When_Visual_Information_Might_Help"},{"id":261051386,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261051386_Group_emotion_estimation_using_Bayesian_network_based_on_facial_expression_and_prosodic_information"},{"id":236624247,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236624247_Spotting_Laughter_in_Natural_Multiparty_Conversations_A_Comparison_of_Automatic_Online_and_Offline_Approaches_Using_Audiovisual_Data"},{"id":234112828,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234112828_Towards_the_automatic_detection_of_spontaneous_agreement_and_disagreement_based_on_nonverbal_behavior_A_survey_of_related_cues_databases_and_tools"},{"id":264048367,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264048367_Proceedings_of_the_First_International_Conference_on_Advanced_Information_Technologies_Applications_ICAITA-2012_Dubai_UAE"},{"id":257093326,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257093326_The_MAHNOB_Laughter_database"},{"id":266656130,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266656130_How_is_your_laugh_today"},{"id":281992672,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281992672_Local_Binary_Patterns_Calculated_Over_Gaussian_Derivative_Images"},{"id":273275594,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273275594_An_Evolutive_Approach_for_Smile_Recognition_in_Video_Sequences"},{"id":280261943,"url":"ht
