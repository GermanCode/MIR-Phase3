{"id":282603739,"title":"Bayesian Fuzzy Clustering","authors":["Taylor C. Glenn","Alina Zare","Paul Gader"],"_abstract":"We present a Bayesian probabilistic model and inference algorithm for fuzzy clustering that provides expanded capabilities over the traditional Fuzzy C-Means approach. Additionally, we extend the Bayesian Fuzzy Clustering model to handle a variable number of clusters and present a particle filter inference technique to estimate the model parameters including the number of clusters. We show results on synthetic and real data and compare with other approaches.","cited_in":[],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279389582_Pattern_Recognition_with_Fuzzy_Objective_Function","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3192088_Unsupervised_Optimal_Fuzzy_Clustering","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220600510_Clustering_by_competitive_agglomeration","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262408955_Bayesian_Fuzzy_Clustering_of_Colored_Graphs","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221216291_A_Probabilistic_Cluster_Validity_Index_for_Agglomerative_Bayesian_Fuzzy_Clustering","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221017973_Bayesian_Validation_of_Fuzzy_Clustering_for_Analysis_of_Yeast_Cell_Cycle_Data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3845535_Using_fuzzy_clustering_to_improve_naive_Bayes_classifiers_and_probabilistic_networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23721076_Bayesian_Fuzzy_Regression_Analysis_and_Model_Selection_Theory_and_Evidence","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220688423_Algorithms_for_Fuzzy_Clustering_-_Methods_in_c-Means_Clustering_with_Applications","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3951728_Fuzzy_c-means_clustering_with_regularization_by_K-L_information","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3336308_Regularized_Linear_Fuzzy_Clustering_and_Probabilistic_PCA_Mixture_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41222435_Monte_Carlo_Statistical_Method","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221996674_The_Infinite_Gaussian_Mixture_Model","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220270203_Infinite_Latent_Feature_Models_and_the_Indian_Buffet_Process","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227280412_CONDENSATION-conditional_density_propagation_for_visual_tracking","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220690050_Probabilistic_Graphical_Models_Principles_and_Techniques","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258032902_Comparing_Fuzzy_Probabilistic_and_Possibilistic_Partitions_Using_the_Earth_Mover's_Distance","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220182015_A_Validity_Measure_for_Fuzzy_Clustering","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3949847_Improved_covariance_estimation_for_Gustafson-Kessel_clustering","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3297992_Agglomerative_Fuzzy_K-Means_Clustering_Algorithm_with_Selection_of_Number_of_Clusters","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222028163_Iterative_Bayesian_fuzzy_clustering_toward_flexible_icon-based_assistive_software_for_the_disabled","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23493446_Bayesian_Clustering_of_Fuzzy_Feature_Vectors_Using_a_Quasi-Likelihood_Approach"]}
