ABSTRACT One driving factor improving the resolution of oceanographic sampling has been the observation of fine structure in the ocean. As oceanographers improve their sample resolution, the finer patterns that are discovered lead to a better understanding (and new questions) about dynamic processes in the ocean. To date, current technologies available for the study of many zooplankters remain limited in comparison to the spatial-temporal resolution and data acquisition rate available for physical oceanographic measurements, especially for the relatively rare meso-zooplankton. To overcome these challenges, we have built a towed, very high resolution digital imaging system capable of sampling water volumes sufficient for accurate quantification of meso-zooplankton in situ. The images are high quality, enabling clear identification of meso-zooplankters (e.g. larvaceans, gelatinous zooplankters, chaetognaths, larval fish), often to family or genus level. However, the efforts directed toward high speed and high-resolution imaging have the potential to create a bottleneck in data analysis. To address this problem we also have developed efficient algorithms to detect multiple regions (organisms) of interest (ROI) automatically, while filtering out noise and out-of-focus organisms, and simultaneously classify the detected organisms into pre-defined categories using shape and texture information. Here we demonstrate the current design, image quality, image analysis approach and example data analyses as an overview of the system capabilities.","cited_in":[],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4351195_Integration_of_active_learning_in_a_collaborative_CRF","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3413896_Recognizing_Plankton_Images_From_the_Shadow_Image_Particle_Profiling_Evaluation_Recorder","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228709395_In_situ_Ichthyoplankton_Imaging_SystemISIIS_system_design_and_preliminary_results","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257439298_Schlieren_and_Shadowgraph_Techniques_Visualizing_Phenomena_in_Transparent_Media_GS_Settles_Springer-Verlag_Berlin_Germany_2001","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227195627_Shadow_cinematography_of_fish_larvae","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2529190_Conditional_Random_Fields_Probabilistic_Models_for_Segmenting_and_Labeling_Sequence_Data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/44572779_The_Infinite_Hidden_Markov_Random_Field_Model","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221995544_Bishop_CM_Pattern_Recognition_and_Machine_Learning_Springer"]}
