{"id":220655948,"title":"Speaker Diarization: A Review of Recent Research","authors":["Xavier Anguera","Simon Bozonnet","Nicholas Evans","Corinne Fredouille","Gerald Friedland","Oriol Vinyals"],"_abstract":"ABSTRACT Speaker diarization is the task of determining “who spoke when?” in an audio or video recording that contains an unknown amount of speech and also an unknown number of speakers. Initially, it was proposed as a research topic related to automatic speech recognition, where speaker diarization serves as an upstream processing step. Over recent years, however, speaker diarization has become an important key technology for many tasks, such as navigation, retrieval, or higher level inference on audio data. Accordingly, many important improvements in accuracy and robustness have been reported in journals and conferences in the area. The application domains, from broadcast news, to lectures and meetings, vary greatly and pose different problems, such as having access to multiple microphones and multimodal information or overlapping speech. The most recent review of existing technology dates back to 2006 and focuses on the broadcast news domain. In this paper, we review the current state-of-the-art, focusing on research developed since 2006 that relates predominantly to speaker diarization for conference meetings. Finally, we present an analysis of speaker diarization performance as reported through the NIST Rich Transcription evaluations on meeting data and identify important areas for future research.","cited_in":[{"id":283330583,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283330583_Tracking_the_Active_Speaker_Based_on_a_Joint_Audio-Visual_Observation_Model"},{"id":282974661,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282974661_The_2015_Sheffield_system_for_longitudinal_diarisation_of_broadcast_media"},{"id":286924531,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286924531_Speaker_Diarisation_and_Longitudinal_Linking_in_Multi-Genre_Broadcast_Data"},{"id":286496249,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286496249_Statistical_Speaker_Diarization_Using_Dependent_Combination_of_Extracted_Features"},{"id":282000605,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282000605_Fast_Single-_and_Cross-Show_Speaker_Diarization_Using_Binary_Key_Speaker_Modeling"},{"id":285214641,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285214641_Comparison_of_Diarization_Tools_for_Building_Speaker_Database"},{"id":282135336,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282135336_An_Investigation_of_Emotion_Changes_from_Speech"},{"id":281443471,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281443471_Novel_Clustering_Selection_Criterion_for_Fast_Binary_Key_Speaker_Diarization"},{"id":291520449,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291520449_PHONE_ADAPTIVE_TRAINING_FOR_SHORT-DURATION_SPEAKER_VERIFICATION"},{"id":291520360,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291520360_ADAPTIVE_AND_ONLINE_SPEAKER_DIARIZATION_FOR_MEETING_DATA"},{"id":272477173,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272477173_Artificial_neural_network_features_for_speaker_diarization"},{"id":271834878,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271834878_Improving_Overlapping_Speaker_Detection_Using_Multiple_Speaker_Tracking_Information"},{"id":263621069,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263621069_An_Audiovisual_Attention_Model_for_Natural_Conversation_Scenes"},{"id":269408357,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269408357_Segmentation_in_singer_turns_with_the_Bayesian_Information_Criterion"},{"id":264123179,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264123179_Speaker-Following_Video_Subtitles"},{"id":271456341,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271456341_Information_bottleneck_based_speaker_diarization_of_meetings_using_non-speech_as_side_information"},{"id":291520592,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291520592_SHORT-DURATION_SPEAKER_MODELLING_WITH_PHONE_ADAPTIVE_TRAINING"},{"id":261432741,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261432741_Where_are_the_challenges_in_speaker_diarization"},{"id":261432745,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261432745_Prof-Life-Log_Personal_interaction_analysis_for_naturalistic_audio_streams"},{"id":261432739,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261432739_Speaker_diarization_using_data-driven_audio_sequencing"},{"id":261432742,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261432742_Improved_overlap_speech_diarization_of_meeting_recordings_using_long-term_conversational_features"},{"id":261857797,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261857797_SocioPhone_Everyday_face-to-face_interaction_monitoring_platform_using_multi-phone_sensor_fusion"},{"id":281328977,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281328977_Integer_Linear_Programming_for_Speaker_Diarization_and_Cross-Modal_Identification_in_TV_Broadcast"},{"id":259428461,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259428461_Bayesian_approaches_to_acoustic_modeling_A_review"},{"id":220655863,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220655863_A_Comparative_Study_of_Bottom-Up_and_Top-Down_Approaches_to_Speaker_Diarization"},{"id":261399052,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261399052_Integration_of_LDA_into_a_telephone_conversation_speaker_diarization_system"},{"id":230608462,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230608462_Speaker_Diarization_of_Overlapping_Speech_based_on_Silence_Distribution_in_Meeting_Recordings"},{"id":230708615,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230708615_A_Multimodal_Approach_to_Speaker_Diarization_on_TV_Talk-Shows"},{"id":261233285,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261233285_Fast_speaker_diarization_using_a_high-level_scripting_language"},{"id":250003568,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/250003568_Look_at_Who's_Talking_Voice_Activity_Detection_by_Automated_Gesture_Analysis"},{"id":224929623,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224929623_Speech_Overlap_Detection_and_Attribution_Using_Convolutive_Non-Negative_Sparse_Coding"},{"id":254006132,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254006132_Speaker_diarization_using_low-cost_wearable_wireless_sensors"},{"id":257011950,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257011950_Variational_conditional_random_fields_for_online_speaker_detection_and_tracking"},{"id":279449036,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279449036_Towards_an_Unsupervised_Speak
