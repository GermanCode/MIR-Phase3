{"id":282181295,"title":"Deep Temporal Sigmoid Belief Networks for Sequence Modeling","authors":["Zhe Gan","Chunyuan Li","Ricardo Henao","David Carlson","Lawrence Carin"],"_abstract":"Deep dynamic generative models are developed to learn sequential dependencies in time-series data. The multi-layered model is designed by constructing a hierarchy of temporal sigmoid belief networks (TSBNs), defined as a sequential stack of sigmoid belief networks (SBNs). Each SBN has a contextual hidden state, inherited from the previous SBNs in the sequence, and is used to regulate its hidden bias. Scalable learning and inference algorithms are derived by introducing a recognition model that yields fast sampling from the variational posterior. This recognition model is trained jointly with the generative model, by maximizing its variational lower bound on the log-likelihood. Experimental results on bouncing balls, polyphonic music, motion capture, and text streams show that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance, and has the capacity to synthesize various sequences.","cited_in":[{"id":284579582,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284579582_Black_box_variational_inference_for_state_space_models"},{"id":285779762,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285779762_Stochastic_Spectral_Descent_for_Discrete_Graphical_Models"},{"id":284476535,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284476535_Unsupervised_Learning_of_Visual_Structure_using_Predictive_Generative_Networks"},{"id":288059688,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/288059688_High-Order_Stochastic_Gradient_Thermostats_for_Bayesian_Learning_of_Deep_Models"},{"id":288059869,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/288059869_Preconditioned_Stochastic_Gradient_Langevin_Dynamics_for_Deep_Neural_Networks"}],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220049445_An_Introduction_to_Hidden_Markov_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220045413_Mathematical_Description_of_Linear_Dynamical_Systems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221344668_Learning_Recurrent_Neural_Networks_with_Hessian-Free_Optimization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233730646_On_the_difficulty_of_training_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255173850_Generating_Sequences_With_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200744744_Modeling_human_motion_using_binary_latent_variables","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200744461_Learning_multilevel_distributed_representations_for_high-dimensional_sequences","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221619549_The_Recurrent_Temporal_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machine","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228095594_Modeling_Temporal_Dependencies_in_High-Dimensional_SequencesApplication_to_Polyphonic_Music_Generation_and_Transcription","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259400035_Auto-Encoding_Variational_Bayes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260022128_Neural_Variational_Inference_and_Learning_in_Belief_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262991675_Stochastic_Backpropagation_and_Approximate_Inference_in_Deep_Generative_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278244188_Learning_Deep_Sigmoid_Belief_Networks_with_Data_Augmentation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223927652_Connectionist_learning_of_belief_networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7017915_A_Fast_Learning_Algorithm_for_Deep_Belief_Nets","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11207765_ARTICLE_Training_Products_of_Experts_by_Minimizing_Contrastive_Divergence","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221619845_Replicated_Softmax_an_Undirected_Topic_Model","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/15437023_The_wake-sleep_algorithm_for_unsupervised_neural_networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221346352_Factored_conditional_restricted_Boltzmann_Machines_for_modeling_motion_style","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278244488_Scalable_Deep_Poisson_Factor_Analysis_for_Topic_Modeling","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320210_Incremental_Sigmoid_Belief_Networks_for_Grammar_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/15614028_The_Helmholtz_Machine","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268988199_Learning_Stochastic_Recurrent_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269997903_Variational_Recurrent_Auto-Encoders","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277959228_A_Recurrent_Latent_Variable_Model_for_Sequential_Data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274960016_Dynamic_Rank_Factor_Model_for_Text_Streams","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281670476_Fast_Second-Order_Stochastic_Backpropagation_for_Variational_Inference"]}
