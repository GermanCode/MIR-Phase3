Pleasure orientation of a song is estimated first, and then different regressors are used to predict degree of pleasure according to the estimated orientation. By using corresponding regressors for each instance, there is a big improvement when we assume the first layer is perfect in comparison with one-layer model. By tuning the confidence threshold of the orientation classifier of the two-layer model, we get improvement over one-layer model.","cited_in":[{"id":272521878,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272521878_Affective_Music_Information_Retrieval"}],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224166070_Ranking-Based_Emotion_Recognition_for_Music_Organization_and_Retrieval","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228695729_Music_emotion_recognition_A_state_of_the_art_review","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3458005_A_Regression_Approach_to_Music_Emotion_Recognition","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239604183_Affective_Norms_for_English_Words_ANEW_Instruction_Manual_and_Affective_Ratings","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221900777_The_WEKA_data_mining_software_An_update","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224576802_Exploiting_genre_for_music_emotion_classification","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220723083_jAudio_An_Feature_Extraction_Library","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220723554_Boosting_for_Multi-Modal_Music_Emotion_Classification","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26621599_Chi_Square_Feature_Extraction_Based_Svms_Arabic_Language_Text_Categorization_System","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220499847_Local_Learning_Algorithms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220723368_Categories_of_Music_Description_and_Search_Terms_and_Phrases_Used_by_Non-Music_Experts","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221263998_Affective_MTV_analysis_based_on_Arousal_and_Valence_features","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220722894_Prediction_of_Multidimensional_Emotional_Ratings_in_Music_from_Audio_Using_Multivariate_Regression_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224088060_OpenEAR_-_Introducing_the_Munich_open-source_emotion_and_affect_recognition_toolkit","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262403563_On_shape_and_the_computability_of_emotions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225555946_A_note_on_Platt's_probabilistic_outputs_for_support_vector_machines"]}
