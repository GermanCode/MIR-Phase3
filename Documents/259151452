Pettitt"],"_abstract":"ABSTRACT Sampling from Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRFs), that is multivariate Gaussian ran- dom vectors that are parameterised by the inverse of their covariance matrix, is a fundamental problem in computational statistics. In this paper, we show how we can exploit arbitrarily accu- rate approximations to a GMRF to speed up Krylov subspace sampling methods. We also show that these methods can be used when computing the normalising constant of a large multivariate Gaussian distribution, which is needed for both any likelihood-based inference method. The method we derive is also applicable to other structured Gaussian random vectors and, in particu- lar, we show that when the precision matrix is a perturbation of a (block) circulant matrix, it is still possible to derive O(n log n) sampling schemes.","cited_in":[{"id":271218362,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271218362_Enabling_scalable_stochastic_gradient-based_inference_for_Gaussian_processes_by_employing_the_Unbiased_LInear_System_SolvEr_ULISSE"}],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225081349_Coupled_MCMC_with_a_randomized_acceptance_probability","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230872767_Inexact_Newton_Methods","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225359686_Equivalent_operator_preconditioning_for_elliptic_problems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257618460_A_comparative_evaluation_of_stochastic-based_inference_methods_for_Gaussian_process_models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227375782_Riemann_manifold_Langevin_and_Hamiltonian_Monte_Carlo_methods","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227423874_Hybrid_Monte_Carlo_on_Hilbert_spaces","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41016722_Krylov_subspace_methods_for_approximating_functions_of_symmetric_positive_definite_matrices_with_applications_to_applied_statistics_and_anomalous_diffusion","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227701452_Log_Gaussian_Cox_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243668757_A_Stochastic_Estimator_of_the_Trace_of_the_Influence_Matrix_for_Laplacian_Smoothing_Splines","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221661751_MCMC_Methods_for_Functions_Modifying_Old_Algorithms_to_Make_Them_Faster","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51893450_Parameter_Estimation_in_High_Dimensional_Gaussian_Distributions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227375789_An_explicit_link_between_Gaussian_fields_and_Gaussian_Markov_random_fields_The_stochastic_partial_differential_equation_approach_Journal_of_the_Royal_Statistical_Society_Series_B_734_423-498","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226989087_Preconditioning_strategies_for_asymptotically_ill-conditioned_block_Toeplitz_systems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220688947_Accuracy_and_Stability_of_Numerical_Algorithms_SIAM_Philadelphia","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239756954_To_Center_or_Not_to_Center_That_is_Not_the_Question_-_An_Ancillarity-Sufficiency_Interweaving_Strategy_ASIS_for_Boosting_MCMC_Efficiency","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228765709_Covariance_Tapering_for_Interpolation_of_Large_Spatial_Datasets","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242922456_Efficient_Algorithms_for_the_Evaluation_of_the_Eigenvalues_of_Block_Banded_Toeplitz_Matrices","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222471672_Some_large_scale_computation_problems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257665456_Iterative_Numerical_Methods_for_Sampling_from_High_Dimensional_Gaussian_Distributions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247430821_Robust_Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo_methods_for_spatial_generalised_linear_mixed_models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/244450461_A_robust_AINV-type_method_for_constructing_sparse_approximate_inverse_preconditioners_in_factored_form","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/27473662_Fast_sampling_from_a_Gaussian_Markov_random_field_using_Krylov_subspace_approaches","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/1919620_On_the_Numerical_Evaluation_of_Fredholm_Determinants","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4993358_Fixed_rank_Kriging_for_very_large_data_sets","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239524417_Playing_Russian_Roulette_with_Intractable_Likelihoods","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/213881563_Iterative_Methods_for_Sparse_Linear_Systems_Second_Edition","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242309312_Decay_bounds_and_On_algorithms_for_approximating_functions_of_sparse_matrices","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45921723_Slice_sampling_covariance_hyperparameters_of_latent_Gaussian_models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46537493_Approximate_Bayesian_Inference_for_Latent_Gaussian_Models_by_Using_Integrated_Nested_Laplace_Approximations","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227647151_A_new_method_for_computing_the_diagonal_of_a_matrix_inverse","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233282209_Specifying_a_Gaussian_Markov_Random_Field_by_a_Sparse_Cholesky_Triangle","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26808285_Gaussian_predictive_process_models_for_large_spatial_data_sets","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227369107_Covariance_Tapering_for_Likelihood-Based_Estimation_in_Large_Spatial_Data_Sets","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4772040_Fast_sampling_of_Gaussian_Markov_random_fields","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/250956306_The_Collinearity_Problem_in_Linear_Regression_The_Partial_Least_Squares_PLS_Approach_to_Generalized_Inverse","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225860489_A_process-convolution_approach_to_modelling_temperatures_in_the_North_Atlantic_Ocean_Disc_P191-192","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23634990_Convergence_of_posterioris_for_discretized_log_Gaussi
