The observed signal is assumed to be corrupted by an independent and non identically (colored) Gaussian distribution. A prior enforcing a smooth temporal evolution of the model parameters is considered. The joint posterior distribution of the unknown parameter vector is then derived. A Gibbs sampler coupled with a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm is proposed which allows samples distributed according to the posterior of interest to be generated and to estimate the unknown model parameters/hyperparameters. Simulations conducted with synthetic and real satellite altimetric data show the potential of the proposed Bayesian model and the corresponding estimation algorithm for nonlinear regression with smooth estimated parameters.","cited_in":[],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3231593_The_average_impulse_response_of_a_rough_surface_and_its_applications_IEEE_Trans_Antennas_Propag","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224215358_Nonlinear_Unmixing_of_Hyperspectral_Images_Using_a_Generalized_Bilinear_Model","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258793023_Parameter_Estimation_for_Peaky_Altimetric_Waveforms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/44366017_Detection_estimation_and_modulation_theory_Harry_L_Van_Trees","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256821709_Nonlinear_Programming","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224269799_Why_natural_gradient","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259390620_Bayesian_Filtering_and_Smoothing","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/246598264_Kalman_Filtering_and_Neural_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224263852_Some_Relations_Between_Extended_and_Unscented_Kalman_Filters","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261874712_Blind_Image_Deconvolution_Theory_and_Applications","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6645275_Blind_Deconvolution_Using_a_Variational_Approach_to_Parameter_Image_and_Blur_Estimation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262771465_Hyperspectral_Unmixing_With_l_q_Regularization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221662401_Fast_Joint_Detection-Estimation_of_Evoked_Brain_Activity_in_Event-Related_fMRI_Using_a_Variational_Approach","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224212010_Joint_Bayesian_Decomposition_of_a_Spectroscopic_Signal_Sequence","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248982634_Improving_the_Jason1_Ground_Retracking_to_Better_Account_for_Attitude_Effects","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260262522_A_Semi-Analytical_Model_for_DelayDoppler_Altimetry_and_Its_Estimation_Algorithm","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264791754_Including_Antenna_Mispointing_in_a_Semi-Analytical_Model_for_DelayDoppler_Altimetry","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227916094_Improved_ocean-geoid_resolution_from_retracked_ERS-1_satellite_altimeter_waveforms_Geophys_J_Int","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258460792_Retracking_CryoSat-2_Ocean_Waveforms_for_Optimal_Gravity_Field_Recovery","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24165075_Joint_Bayesian_Endmember_Extraction_and_Linear_Unmixing_for_Hyperspectral_Imagery","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41222434_The_Bayesian_Choice_From_Decision_Theoretic_Foundations_to_Computational_Implementation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263281119_Unsupervised_Unmixing_of_Hyperspectral_Images_Accounting_for_Endmember_Variability","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224116976_SAR_altimeter_retracker_performance_bound_over_water_surfaces","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2176202_A_revisit_to_the_GNSS-R_code_range_precision","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259704202_Cramer-Rao_bounds_and_estimation_algorithms_for_DelayDoppler_and_conventional_altimetry"]}
