{"id":221110148,"title":"Probabilistic image segmentation with closedness constraints","authors":["Bjoern Andres","Joerg Hendrik Kappes","Thorsten Beier","Ullrich KÃ¶the","Fred A. Hamprecht"],"_abstract":"ABSTRACT We propose a novel graphical model for probabilistic image segmentation that contributes both to aspects of perceptual grouping in connection with image segmentation, and to globally optimal inference with higher-order graphical models. We represent image partitions in terms of cellular complexes in order to make the duality between connected regions and their contours explicit. This allows us to formulate a graphical model with higher-order factors that represent the requirement that all contours must be closed. The model induces a probability measure on the space of all partitions, concentrated on perceptually meaningful segmentations. We give a complete polyhedral characterization of the resulting global inference problem in terms of the multicut polytope and efficiently compute global optima by a cutting plane method. Competitive results for the Berkeley segmentation benchmark confirm the consistency of our approach.","cited_in":[{"id":290978520,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/290978520_A_Multiscale_Particle_Filter_and_Winding_Number_Constrained_for_Contour_Detection"},{"id":283762266,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283762266_Spatially_Coherent_Random_Forests"},{"id":284168622,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284168622_Moral_Lineage_Tracing"},{"id":281608020,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281608020_Convexity_Shape_Constraints_for_Image_Segmentation"},{"id":279968378,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279968378_Planar_Ultrametric_Rounding_for_Image_Segmentation"},{"id":275953461,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275953461_Superpixel_Optimization_using_Higher-Order_Energy"},{"id":273101688,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273101688_Fusion_Moves_for_Correlation_Clustering"},{"id":264535188,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264535188_Estimating_Maximally_Probable_Constrained_Relations_by_Mathematical_Programming"},{"id":264547309,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264547309_Asymmetric_Cuts_Joint_Image_Labeling_and_Partitioning"},{"id":236946605,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236946605_Higher-order_Segmentation_via_Multicuts"},{"id":221870508,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221870508_3D_segmentation_of_SBFSEM_images_of_neuropil_by_a_graphical_model_over_supervoxel_boundaries"},{"id":225433010,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225433010_Globally_Optimal_Image_Partitioning_by_Multicuts"},{"id":261500023,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261500023_Connected_Contours_a_New_Contour_Completion_Model_that_Respects_the_Closure_Effect"},{"id":230609986,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230609986_Fast_Planar_Correlation_Clustering_for_Image_Segmentation"},{"id":262209806,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262209806_Globally_Optimal_Closed-Surface_Segmentation_for_Connectomics"},{"id":260432402,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260432402_Learning_to_Segment_Neurons_with_Non-local_Quality_Measures"},{"id":261226306,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261226306_A_Comparative_Study_of_Modern_Inference_Techniques_for_Discrete_Energy_Minimization_Problems"},{"id":261259189,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261259189_Winding_Number_for_Region-Boundary_Consistent_Salient_Contour_Extraction"},{"id":286486248,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286486248_Segmenting_Planar_Superpixel_Adjacency_Graphs_wrt_Non-planar_Superpixel_Affinity_Graphs"},{"id":256102500,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256102500_Machine_Learning_of_Hierarchical_Clustering_to_Segment_2D_and_3D_Images"},{"id":262404261,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262404261_Weakly_Supervised_Learning_of_Image_Partitioning_Using_Decision_Trees_with_Structured_Split_Criteria"},{"id":263887601,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263887601_Cut_Glue_Cut_A_Fast_Approximate_Solver_for_Multicut_Partitioning"},{"id":267274147,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267274147_Cell_Detection_and_Segmentation_Using_Correlation_Clustering"},{"id":268794270,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268794270_Winding_Number_Constrained_Contour_Detection"},{"id":286621959,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286621959_Learning_to_detect_contours_with_dynamic_programming_snakes"},{"id":282329142,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282329142_Hierarchical_Planar_Correlation_Clustering_for_Cell_Segmentation"},{"id":273101920,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273101920_Probabilistic_Correlation_Clustering_and_Image_Partitioning_Using_Perturbed_Multicuts"},{"id":281789430,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281789430_Correlation_clustering_and_two-edge-connected_augmentation_for_planar_graphs"},{"id":282613509,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282613509_A_Comparative_Study_of_Modern_Inference_Techniques_for_Structured_Discrete_Energy_Minimization_Problems"},{"id":277334503,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277334503_Efficient_Decomposition_of_Image_and_Mesh_Graphs_by_Lifted_Multicuts"}],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228723293_Boundary_extraction_in_natural_images_using_ultrametric_contour_maps","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221996717_Objective_Criteria_for_the_Evaluation_of_Clustering_Methods","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221361944_Using_contours_to_detect_and_localize_junctions_in_natural_images","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221363985_Optimizing_Binary_MRFs_via_Extended_Roof_Duality","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220728684_Globally_Optimal_Image_Partitioning_by_Multicuts","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238179827_An_application_of_combinatorial_optimization_to_statistical_optimization_and_circuit_layout_design","http
