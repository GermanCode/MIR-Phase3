Through this framework we investigate issue of invariance of the optimization, data dependence and the connection with natural gradients.","cited_in":[],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2433873_Natural_Gradient_Works_Efficiently_in_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215616968_Understanding_the_difficulty_of_training_deep_feedforward_neural_networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272194743_Batch_Normalization_Accelerating_Deep_Network_Training_by_Reducing_Internal_Covariate_Shift","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320088_Exploring_Strategies_for_Training_Deep_Neural_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221345102_Deep_learning_via_Hessian-free_optimization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273787871_Optimizing_Neural_Networks_with_Kronecker-factored_Approximate_Curvature","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277959140_Path-SGD_Path-Normalized_Optimization_in_Deep_Neural_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273067607_Norm-Based_Capacity_Control_in_Neural_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269935450_In_Search_of_the_Real_Inductive_Bias_On_the_Role_of_Implicit_Regularization_in_Deep_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258816388_Revisiting_Natural_Gradient_for_Deep_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221619092_Topmoumoute_Online_Natural_Gradient_Algorithm","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51956672_Krylov_Subspace_Descent_for_Deep_Learning"]}
