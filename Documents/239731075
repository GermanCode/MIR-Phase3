{"id":239731075,"title":"Bayesian Clustering of Animal Abundance Trends For Inference and Dimension Reduction","authors":["Devin S Johnson","Rolf R. Ream","Rodg. Towell","Michael T. Williams","Andjuand. Leonguerrero"],"_abstract":"We consider a model-based clustering approach to examining abundance trends in a metapopulation. When examining trends for an animal population with management goals in mind one is often interested in those segments of the population that behave similarly to one another with respect to abundance. Our proposed trend analysis in- corporates a clustering method that is an extension of the classic Chinese Restaurant Process, and the associated Dirichlet process prior, which allows for inclusion of dis- tance covariates between sites. This approach has two main benefits: (1) nonparametric spatial association of trends and (2) reduced dimension of the spatio-temporal trend process. We present a transdimensional Gibbs sampler for making Bayesian inference that is efficient in the sense that all of the full conditionals can be directly sampled from save one. To demonstrate the proposed method we examine long term trends in northern fur seal pup production at 19 rookeries in the Pribilof Islands, Alaska. There was strong evidence that clustering of similar year-to-year deviation from linear trends was associ- ated with whether rookeries were located on the same island. Clustering of local linear trends did not seem to be strongly associated with any of the distance covariates. In the fur seal trends analysis an overwhelming proportion of the MCMC iterations produced a 73â€“79 % reduction in the dimension of the spatio-temporal trend process, depending on the number of cluster groups.","cited_in":[],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38326987_Nonparametric_Bayesian_Data_Analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/250018790_Estimation_of_Fur_Seal_Pup_Populations_by_Randomized_Sampling","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2741222_Bayesian_Density_Estimation_and_Inference_Using_Mixtures","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249474043_Decline_in_northern_fur_seal_Callorhinus_ursinus_pup_production_on_the_Pribilof_Islands","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2468788_Estimating_Mixture_of_Dirichlet_Process_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229100346_Markov_Chain_Sampling_Methods_for_Dirichlet_Process_Mixture_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38357634_A_Bayesian_Analysis_of_Some_Non-Parametric_Problems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222828416_On_selecting_a_prior_for_the_precision_parameter_of_Dirichlet_process_mixture_models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45876667_Distance_Dependent_Chinese_Restaurant_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227548159_Inferring_spatial_structure_from_time-series_data_using_multivariate_state-space_models_to_detect_metapopulation_structure_of_California_sea_lions_in_the_Gulf_of_California_Mexico_J_Appl_Ecol","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227798957_Foraging_habitats_based_on_the_diet_of_female_northern_fur_seals_Callorhinus_ursinus_on_the_Pribilof_Islands_Alaska","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4741897_Space-Time_Covariance_Functions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6158335_Modeling_Unobserved_Sources_of_Heterogeneity_in_Animal_Abundance_Using_a_Dirichlet_Process_Prior"]}
