{"id":277289463,"title":"Optimal scaling of Metropolis algorithms: is 0.234 as robust as believed?","authors":["Mylène Bédard","Jeffrey S. Rosenthal"],"_abstract":"The Metropolis algorithm with Gaussian proposal distribution is a popular sampling method; it is versatile and easy to implement. Optimal scaling theory aims to improve the speed of convergence of this algorithm to its stationary distribution by carefully selecting its tuning parameter. This paper is an overview of existing optimal scaling results and addresses in more depth the case of high-dimensional target distributions formed of independent, but not identically distributed components. It attempts to give an intuitive explanation as to when the previously-derived optimal acceptance rate of 0.234 is indeed optimal, and when it is unsuitable. In the latter case, it also explains how to find the correct asymptotically optimal acceptance rate, and why we sometimes have to turn to inhomogeneous proposal variances in order to obtain an efficient algorithm. This is all illustrated with a simple example.","cited_in":[{"id":253086774,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/253086774_Nonlinear_filters_with_log-homotopy"},{"id":251867366,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/251867366_Nonlinear_filters_for_long_range_radars"},{"id":253456775,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/253456775_Particle_flow_for_nonlinear_filters_with_log-homotopy"}],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/1771219_Bedard_M_Weak_convergence_of_metropolis_algorithms_for_non-iid_target_distributions_Ann_Appl_Probab_17_1222-1244","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222298844_Optimal_acceptance_rates_for_Metropolis_algorithms_Movin_beyond_0234","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245994595_Efficient_Sampling_Using_Metropolis_Algorithms_Applications_of_Optimal_Scaling_Results","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243776875_Spatial_Statistics_and_Bayesian_Computing","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243103678_Bayesian_Computation_and_Stochastic_Systems_Rejoinder","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2113732_Optimal_Scaling_of_Mala_for_Nonlinear_Regression","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227425151_From_Metropolis_to_Diffusions_Gibbs_States_and_Optimal_Scaling_Stochastic_Process","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2834582_Scaling_Limits_for_the_Transient_Phase_of_Local_Metropolis-Hastings_Algorithms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243739482_Efficient_Metropolis_Jumping_Rules","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/31403274_Monte_Carlo_Sampling_Methods_Using_Markov_Chains_and_Their_Application","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/244509996_The_Multiple-Try_Method_and_Local_Optimization_in_Metropolis_Sampling","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200105001_Equation_of_State_by_Fast_Computing_Machines","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2129242_Optimal_scaling_for_partially_updating_MCMC_algorithms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232276216_Optimal_scaling_of_random_walk_Metropolis_algorithms_with_discontinuoustarget_densities","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228280215_Adaptively_Scaling_the_Metropolis_Algorithm_Using_Expected_Squared_Jumped_Distance","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2583743_Weak_Convergence_And_Optimal_Scaling_Of_Random_Walk_Metropolis_Algorithms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227672958_Optimal_scaling_of_discrete_approximations_to_Langevin_diffusions_J_R_Stat_Soc_Ser_B_Stat_Methodol","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38326865_Optimal_Scaling_for_Various_Metropolis-Hastings_Algorithms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239593783_Methodology_for_Inference_on_the_Markov_Modulated_Poisson_Process_and_Theory_for_Optimal_Scaling_of_the_Random_Walk_Metropolis"]}
