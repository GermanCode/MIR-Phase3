{"id":267947119,"title":"A Stick-Breaking Likelihood for Categorical Data Analysis with Latent Gaussian Models","authors":["Mohammad Emtiyaz Khan","Shakir Mohamed","Benjamin M Marlin","Kevin P Murphy"],"_abstract":"The development of accurate models and effi-cient algorithms for the analysis of multivari-ate categorical data are important and long-standing problems in machine learning and computational statistics. In this paper, we focus on modeling categorical data using La-tent Gaussian Models (LGMs). We propose a novel stick-breaking likelihood function for categorical LGMs that exploits accurate lin-ear and quadratic bounds on the logistic log-partition function, leading to an effective variational inference and learning framework. We thoroughly compare our approach to ex-isting algorithms for multinomial logit/probit likelihoods on several problems, including in-ference in multinomial Gaussian process clas-sification and learning in latent factor mod-els. Our extensive comparisons demonstrate that our stick-breaking model effectively cap-tures correlation in discrete data and is well suited for the analysis of categorical data.","cited_in":[{"id":273388187,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273388187_Latent_Gaussian_Processes_for_Distribution_Estimation_of_Multivariate_Categorical_Data"},{"id":266502061,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266502061_Fast_Bayesian_Inference_for_Non-Conjugate_Gaussian_Process_Regression"},{"id":288077707,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/288077707_Automated_variational_inference_for_Gaussian_process_models"},{"id":278670630,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278670630_Can_Zakat_System_Alleviate_Rural_Poverty_in_Bangladesh_a_propensity_score_matching_approach"},{"id":281791367,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281791367_Can_Zakat_System_Alleviate_Rural_Poverty_in_Bangladesh_A_Propensity_Score_Matching_Approach"}],"reference":[]}
