Turner","Zoubin Ghahramani"],"_abstract":"ABSTRACT The variational framework for learning inducing variables Titsias (2009) has had a large impact on the Gaussian process literature. The framework may be interpreted as minimizing a rigorously defined Kullback-Leibler divergence between the approximate and posterior processes. To our knowledge this connection has thus far gone unremarked in the literature. Many of the technical requirements for such a result were derived in the pioneering work of Seeger (2003,2003b). In this work we give a relatively gentle and largely self-contained explanation of the result. The result is important in understanding the variational inducing framework and could lead to principled novel generalizations.","cited_in":[{"id":278332447,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278332447_MCMC_for_Variationally_Sparse_Gaussian_Processes"}],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266271350_CONVOLVED_GAUSSIAN_PROCESS_PRIORS_FOR_MULTIVARIATE_REGRESSION_WITH_APPLICATIONS_TO_DYNAMICAL_SYSTEMS","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232805135_Deep_Gaussian_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256504640_Probability_and_Measure","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265507008_Prevalence_A_Translation-Invariant_Almost_Every_on_Infinite-Dimensional_Spaces","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2543633_PAC-Bayesian_Generalisation_Error_Bounds_for_Gaussian_Process_Classification","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320048_Variational_Learning_of_Inducing_Variables_in_Sparse_Gaussian_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235409940_Measure_integral_and_probability","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265469282_Variational_Inference_for_Uncertainty_on_the_Inputs_of_Gaussian_Process_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257069490_Gaussian_Processes_for_Big_Data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228092206_Stochastic_Variational_Inference","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320635_Bayesian_Gaussian_Process_Latent_Variable_Model","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262348245_Variational_Multinomial_Logit_Gaussian_Process","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268079368_Scalable_Variational_Gaussian_Process_Classification","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/40498273_Gaussian_Processes_-_Iterative_Sparse_Approximations","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11500673_Sparse_On-Line_Gaussian_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2893638_Bayesian_Gaussian_Process_Models_PAC-Bayesian_Generalisation_Error_Bounds_and_Sparse_Approximations","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269116839_Nested_Variational_Compression_in_Deep_Gaussian_Processes"]}
