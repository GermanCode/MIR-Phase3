Xing"],"_abstract":"ABSTRACT We introduce scalable deep kernels, which combine the structural properties of deep learning architectures with the non-parametric flexibility of kernel methods. Specifically, we transform the inputs of a spectral mixture base kernel with a deep architecture, using local kernel interpolation, inducing points, and structure exploiting (Kronecker and Toeplitz) algebra for a scalable kernel representation. These closed-form kernels can be used as drop-in replacements for standard kernels, with benefits in expressive power and scalability. We jointly learn the properties of these kernels through the marginal likelihood of a Gaussian process. Inference and learning cost $O(n)$ for $n$ training points, and predictions cost $O(1)$ per test point. On a large and diverse collection of applications, including a dataset with 2 million examples, we show improved performance over scalable Gaussian processes with flexible kernel learning models, and stand-alone deep architectures.","cited_in":[],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221322328_On_the_Surprising_Behavior_of_Distance_Metrics_in_High_Dimensional_Space","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260340965_Manifold_Gaussian_Processes_for_Regression","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232805135_Deep_Gaussian_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320835_Multiple_Kernel_Learning_Algorithms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260637318_Deep_Neural_Networks_for_Acoustic_Modeling_in_Speech_Recognition_The_Shared_Views_of_Four_Research_Groups","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7017915_A_Fast_Learning_Algorithm_for_Deep_Belief_Nets","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264979485_Caffe_Convolutional_Architecture_for_Fast_Feature_Embedding","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268155634_Unifying_Visual-Semantic_Embeddings_with_Multimodal_Neural_Language_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267960550_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2985446_Gradient-based_learning_applied_to_document_recognition_Proc_IEEE","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260250756_Automatic_Construction_and_Natural-Language_Description_of_Nonparametric_Regression_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266349214_Introduction_to_Gaussian_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239666609_Bayesian_Learning_for_Neural_Networks_PhD_thesis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41781406_A_Unifying_View_of_Sparse_Approximate_Gaussian_Process_Regression","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/50402307_Gaussian_Processes_for_Machine_Learning_GPML_toolbox","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255991781_Scalable_Inference_for_Structured_Gaussian_Process_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221619441_Using_Deep_Belief_Nets_to_Learn_Covariance_Kernels_for_Gaussian_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228452494_Dynamic_Pooling_and_Unfolding_Recursive_Autoencoders_for_Paraphrase_Detection","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235638891_Gaussian_Process_Covariance_Kernels_for_Pattern_Discovery_andExtrapolation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283532531_Thoughts_on_Massively_Scalable_Gaussian_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51946702_Gaussian_Process_Regression_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272194766_Show_Attend_and_Tell_Neural_Image_Caption_Generation_with_Visual_Attention","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269876253_A_la_Carte_-_Learning_Fast_Kernels"]}
