{"id":230700205,"title":"Auto-WEKA: Combined Selection and Hyperparameter Optimization of Classification Algorithms","authors":["Chris Thornton","Frank Hutter","Holger H Hoos","Kevin Leyton-Brown"],"_abstract":"Many different machine learning algorithms exist; taking into account each algorithm's hyperparameters, there is a staggeringly large number of possible alternatives overall. We consider the problem of simultaneously selecting a learning algorithm and setting its hyperparameters, going beyond previous work that addresses these issues in isolation. We show that this problem can be addressed by a fully automated approach, leveraging recent innovations in Bayesian optimization. Specifically, we consider a wide range of feature selection techniques (combining 3 search and 8 evaluator methods) and all classification approaches implemented in WEKA, spanning 2 ensemble methods, 10 meta-methods, 27 base classifiers, and hyperparameter settings for each classifier. On each of 21 popular datasets from the UCI repository, the KDD Cup 09, variants of the MNIST dataset and CIFAR-10, we show classification performance often much better than using standard selection/hyperparameter optimization methods. We hope that our approach will help non-expert users to more effectively identify machine learning algorithms and hyperparameter settings appropriate to their applications, and hence to achieve improved performance.","cited_in":[{"id":286792242,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286792242_Learning_Linguistic_Biomarkers_for_Predicting_Mild_Cognitive_Impairment_using_Compound_Skip-grams"},{"id":283659038,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283659038_Learning_Linguistic_Biomarkers_for_Predicting_Mild_Cognitive_Impairment_using_Compound_Skip-grams"},{"id":275966269,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275966269_To_tune_or_not_to_tune_recommending_when_to_adjust_SVM_hyper-parameters_via_Meta-learning"},{"id":275966194,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275966194_Effectiveness_of_Random_Search_in_SVM_hyper-parameter_tuning"},{"id":277958776,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277958776_ASlib_A_Benchmark_Library_for_Algorithm_Selection"},{"id":266622312,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266622312_Automatic_model_selection_for_high-dimensional_survival_analysis"},{"id":279274976,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279274976_Generating_Personalized_Algorithms_to_Learn_Bayesian_Network_Classifiers_for_Fraud_Detection_in_Web_Transactions"},{"id":263773784,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263773784_Recommending_Learning_Algorithms_and_Their_Associated_Hyperparameters"},{"id":260725509,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260725509_Introduction_to_multivariate_discrimination"},{"id":261124553,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261124553_Continuous_hyperparameter_optimization_for_large-scale_recommender_systems"},{"id":275966998,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275966998_Meta-Learning_and_Algorithm_Selection"},{"id":265687283,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265687283_Raiders_of_the_Lost_Architecture_Kernels_for_Bayesian_Optimization_in_Conditional_Parameter_Spaces"},{"id":286713560,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286713560_A_Learning-based_Selection_for_Portfolio_Scheduling_of_Scientific_Applications_on_Heterogeneous_Computing_Systems"},{"id":279274770,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279274770_A_Hyper-Heuristic_Evolutionary_Algorithm_for_Learning_Bayesian_Network_Classifiers"},{"id":269693242,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269693242_Heuristic_Generation_via_Parameter_Tuning_for_Online_Bin_Packing"},{"id":281056381,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281056381_Robust_optimization_of_SVM_hyperparameters_in_the_classification_of_bioactive_compounds"},{"id":283764352,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283764352_Sharing_RapidMiner_workflows_and_experiments_with_OpenML"},{"id":275974399,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275974399_The_Configurable_SAT_Solver_Challenge_CSSC"},{"id":275652955,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275652955_Algorithm_selection_for_black-box_continuous_optimization_problems_A_survey_on_methods_and_challenges"},{"id":279458782,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279458782_Neural_Simpletrons_-_Minimalistic_Probabilistic_Networks_for_Learning_With_Few_Labels"},{"id":280998994,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280998994_Extinction_Events_Can_Accelerate_Evolution"},{"id":282733147,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282733147_Concept_of_rule-based_configurator_for_Auto-WEKA_using_OpenML"},{"id":282809201,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282809201_Meta-learning_Recommendation_of_Default_Hyper-parameter_Values_for_SVMs_in_Classifications_Tasks"},{"id":282295406,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282295406_MLBCD_a_machine_learning_tool_for_big_clinical_data"},{"id":289828607,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289828607_Towards_a_Data_Science_Collaboratory"},{"id":273970512,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273970512_Towards_Cognitive_Pipelines_of_Medical_Assistance_Algorithms"}],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221900777_The_WEKA_data_mining_software_An_update","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225237917_Efficient_Global_Optimization_of_Expensive_Black-Box_Functions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/216816964_Algorithms_for_Hyper-Parameter_Optimization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2360567_Hoeffding_Races_Accelerating_Model_Selection_Search_for_Classification_and_Function_Approximation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221608790_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220344215_Ranking_Learning_Algorithms_Using_IBL_and_Meta-Learning_on_Accuracy_and_Time_Results","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260345678_Opportunity_Cost_in_Bayesian_Optimization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221345088_Meta-Learning_by_Landmarking_Various_Learning_Algorithms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262395872_Random_Search_for_Hyper-Parameter_Optimization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2375370_A_Perspective_View_And_Survey_Of_Meta-Learning","https://w
