{"id":23630041,"title":"Canonical row-column-exchangeable arrays","authors":["James Lynch"],"_abstract":"Consider a standard row-column-exchangeable array X = (Xij : i,j >= 1), i.e., Xij = f(a, [xi]i, [eta]j, [lambda]ij) is a function of i.i.d. random variables. It is shown that there is a canonical version of X, X', such that X', and [alpha]', [xi]'1, [xi]'2,..., [eta]'1, [eta]'2,..., are conditionally independent given [intersection]n >= 1 [sigma](X'ij : max(i,j) >= n). This result is quite a bit simpler to prove than the analogous result for the original array X, which is due to Aldous.","cited_in":[{"id":243766298,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243766298_Exchangeability_and_Related_Topics"},{"id":227255582,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227255582_Some_new_representations_in_bivariate_exchangeability"},{"id":23630443,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23630443_On_the_representation_theorem_for_exchangeable_arrays"},{"id":23630468,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23630468_Tail_fields_of_partially_exchangeable_arrays"},{"id":277290443,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277290443_Block-Factor_Fields_Of_Bernoulli_Shifts"},{"id":2757185,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2757185_Block-Factor_Fields_Of_Bernoulli_Shifts"}],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222375400_Representations_for_partially_exchangeable_arrays_of_random_variables"]}
