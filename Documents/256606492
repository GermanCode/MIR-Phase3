{"id":256606492,"title":"Concentration inequalities for sampling without replacement","authors":["RÃ©mi Bardenet","Odalric-Ambrym Maillard"],"_abstract":"ABSTRACT Concentration inequalities quantify the deviation of a random variable from a fixed value. In spite of numerous applications, such as opinion surveys or ecological counting procedures, few concentration results are known for the setting of sampling without replacement from a finite population. Until now, the best general concentration inequality has been a Hoeffding inequality due to Serfling (1974). In this paper, we first improve on the fundamental result of Serfling (1974), and further extend it to obtain a Bernstein concentration bound for sampling without replacement. We then derive an empirical version of our bound that does not require the variance to be known to the user.","cited_in":[{"id":280589611,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280589611_How_Can_Subsampling_Reduce_Complexity_in_Sequential_MCMC_Methods_and_Deal_with_Big_Data_in_Target_Tracking"},{"id":280589952,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280589952_Exponential_bounds_for_the_hypergeometric_distribution"},{"id":267759898,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267759898_Validation_of_Network_Reconciliation"},{"id":264708143,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264708143_The_convex_distance_inequality_for_dependent_random_variables_with_applications_to_the_stochastic_travelling_salesman_and_other_problems"},{"id":268747974,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268747974_Big_Learning_with_Bayesian_Methods"},{"id":279633530,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279633530_Subsampling-Based_Approximate_Monte_Carlo_for_Discrete_Distributions"},{"id":280970148,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280970148_Distribution-Free_Detection_of_Structured_Anomalies_Permutation_and_Rank-Based_Scans"}],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228057769_Probability_Inequalities_for_Sums_of_Bounded_Random_Variables","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41781172_Concentration_Inequalities_for_Sub-Additive_Functions_Using_the_Entropy_Method","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220357686_Centering_Sequences_with_Bounded_Differences","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38357750_Probability_Inequalities_for_the_Sum_in_Sampling_without_Replacement","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45863486_Empirical_Bernstein_Bounds_and_Sample_Variance_Penalization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232128642_A_Generalization_of_Sampling_Without_Replacement_From_a_Finite_Universe","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220345492_Concentration_inequalities_for_functions_of_independent_variables","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221996154_Probability_Inequalities_For_Sums_of_Bounded_Random_Variables","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/244506454_On_Concentration-of-Measure_Inequalities","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220151284_Exploration-exploitation_tradeoff_using_variance_estimates_in_multi-armed_bandits","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236240995_Exploration_and_Exploitation_of_Scratch_Games"]}
