{"id":254257855,"title":"Transfer Learning with One-Class Data","authors":["Jixu Chen","Xiaoming Liu"],"_abstract":"When training and testing data are drawn from different distributions, most statis-tical models need to be retrained using the newly collected data. Transfer learning is a family of algorithms that improves the classifier learning in a target domain of interest by transferring the knowledge from one or multiple source domains, where the data falls in a different distribution. In this paper, we consider a new scenario of transfer learning for two-class classification, where only data samples from one of the two classes (e.g., the negative class) are available in the target domain. We introduce a regression-based one-class transfer learning algorithm to tackle this new problem. In contrast to the traditional discriminative feature selection, which seeks the best classification performance in the training data, we propose a new framework to learn the most transferable discriminative features suitable for our transfer learning. The experiment demonstrates improved per-formance in the applications of facial expression recognition and facial landmark detection.","cited_in":[{"id":261375064,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261375064_Unregistered_Biological_Words_Recognition_by_Q-Learning_with_Transfer_Learning"},{"id":271737554,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271737554_A_robust_one-class_transfer_learning_method_with_uncertain_data"},{"id":263813249,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263813249_Transfer_learning_using_the_online_Fuzzy_Min-Max_neural_network"},{"id":284735023,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284735023_A_live_video_analytic_system_for_affect_analysis_in_public_space"},{"id":283017569,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283017569_Multi-modality_Imagery_Database_for_Plant_Phenotyping"}],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222301239_Facial_expression_recognition_from_video_sequences_temporal_and_static_modeling_Comput_Vis_Image_Underst_911-2160-187","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4047465_Building_Text_Classifiers_Using_Positive_and_Unlabeled_Examples","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222574859_Facial_expression_recognition_based_on_Local_Binary_Patterns_A_comprehensive_study","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221573004_Cross-domain_video_concept_detection_using_adaptive_svms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224604612_A_Survey_on_Transfer_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/49628576_Automatically_Detecting_Pain_in_Video_Through_Facial_Action_Units","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220073002_Bregman_Divergence-Based_Regularization_for_Transfer_Subspace_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258055965_Localizing_Parts_of_Faces_Using_a_Consensus_of_Exemplars","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41781559_Gaussian_Process_for_Machine_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221620154_Correcting_Sample_Selection_Bias_by_Unlabeled_Data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215992302_Confidence_Intervals_for_the_Area_under_the_ROC_Curve","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221619182_Direct_Importance_Estimation_with_Model_Selection_and_Its_Application_to_Covariate_Shift_Adaptation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26820503_Discriminative_Face_Alignment","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221292544_Painful_data_The_UNBC-McMaster_shoulder_pain_expression_archive_database","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221995544_Bishop_CM_Pattern_Recognition_and_Machine_Learning_Springer","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221362759_Calibration-free_gaze_sensing_using_saliency_maps","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51940893_Domain_Adaptation_for_Statistical_Classifiers","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51925348_Visual_event_recognition_in_videos_by_learning_from_web_data_In_IEEE_CVPR","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224254959_What_you_saw_is_not_what_you_get_Domain_adaptation_using_asymmetric_kernel_transforms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2870994_Building_Text_Classifiers_Using_Positive_and_Unlabeled_Examples","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7528499_On-Line_Selection_of_Discriminative_Tracking_Features","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221361941_Boosting_for_transfer_learning_with_multiple_sources","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221110017_Domain_adaptation_for_object_recognition_An_unsupervised_approach","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2900541_Active_appearance_models_revisited_IJCV_602_135-164","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221489900_Eigenvoices_for_speaker_adaptation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221364966_Transfer_Learning_in_Sign_language","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261392002_Nearest_neighbor-based_importance_weighting","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4301657_Active_Learning_with_Gaussian_Processes_for_Object_Categorization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220766249_Using_Wikipedia_for_Co-clustering_Based_Cross-Domain_Text_Classification","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2552275_Partially_Supervised_Classification_of_Text_Documents","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2943806_Learning_and_Evaluating_Classifiers_under_Sample_Selection_Bias","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220270181_Learning_Bounds_for_Importance_Weighting","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6690158_Face_Description_with_Local_Binary_Patterns_Application_to_Face_Recognition","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221346478_Boosting_for_Transfer_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4038437_On-line_selection_of_discriminative_tracking_features","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221259356_Boosted_Regression_Active_Shape_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221345999_Self-taught_clustering","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228776646_Additive_Logistic_Regression_A_Statistical_View_of_Boosting","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220777387_Importance_Weighted_A
