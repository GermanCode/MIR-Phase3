{"id":267767940,"title":"Non-conjugate Variational Message Passing for Multinomial and Binary Regression","authors":["David A. Knowles","Thomas P Minka"],"_abstract":"ABSTRACT Variational Message Passing (VMP) is an algorithmic implementation of the Vari-ational Bayes (VB) method which applies only in the special case of conjugate exponential family models. We propose an extension to VMP, which we refer to as Non-conjugate Variational Message Passing (NCVMP) which aims to alleviate this restriction while maintaining modularity, allowing choice in how expecta-tions are calculated, and integrating into an existing message-passing framework: Infer.NET. We demonstrate NCVMP on logistic binary and multinomial regres-sion. In the multinomial case we introduce a novel variational bound for the soft-max factor which is tighter than other commonly used bounds whilst maintaining computational tractability.","cited_in":[{"id":273388187,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273388187_Latent_Gaussian_Processes_for_Distribution_Estimation_of_Multivariate_Categorical_Data"},{"id":272845343,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272845343_Latent_quality_models_for_document_networks"},{"id":51893132,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51893132_Approximate_inference_via_variational_sampling"},{"id":228083473,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228083473_Fixed-Form_Variational_Posterior_Approximation_through_Stochastic_Linear_Regression"},{"id":257435966,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257435966_A_review_of_deterministic_approximate_inference_techniques_for_Bayesian_machine_learning"},{"id":281455293,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281455293_Streamlined_mean_field_variational_Bayes_for_longitudinal_and_multilevel_data_analysis"},{"id":289695017,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289695017_A_comparison_of_variational_approximations_for_fast_inference_in_mixed_logit_models"}],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221346428_Piecewise_Bounds_for_Estimating_Bernoulli-Logistic_Latent_Gaussian_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221618475_Parameter_Expanded_Variational_Bayesian_Methods","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320406_Building_Blocks_for_Variational_Bayesian_Learning_of_Latent_Variable_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2694888_A_Mean_Field_Learning_Algorithm_For_Unsupervised_Neural_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254212653_Mean_Field_Variational_Bayes_for_Elaborate_Distributions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24052099_Multinomial_logistic_regression_algorithm","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220270112_Variational_Bounds_for_Mixed-Data_Factor_Analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/251955941_Efficient_Bounds_for_the_Softmax_Function_and_Applications_to_Approximate_Inference_in_Hybrid_models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320310_Variational_Message_Passing","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2365311_A_variational_approach_to_Bayesian_logistic_regression_models_and_their_extensions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23252767_The_Variational_Gaussian_Approximation_Revisited","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320926_Approximate_Riemannian_Conjugate_Gradient_Learning_for_Fixed-Form_Variational_Bayes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221139298_Natural_Conjugate_Gradient_in_Variational_Inference","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234108836_Expectation_Propagation_for_Approximate_Bayesian_Inference","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/1761888_A_correlated_topic_model_of_Science","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41781800_Approximations_for_Binary_Gaussian_Process_Classification","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224881741_Variational_Bayesian_Learning_of_Directed_Graphical_Models_with_Hidden_Variables","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220499817_Variational_Bayesian_Multinomial_Probit_Regression_with_Gaussian_Process_Priors"]}
