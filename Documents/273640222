{"id":273640222,"title":"Light and Widely Applicable MCMC: Approximate Bayesian Inference for Large Datasets","authors":["Florian Maire","Nial Friel","Pierre Alquier"],"_abstract":"ABSTRACT Light and Widely Applicable (LWA-) MCMC is a novel approximation of the Metropolis-Hastings kernel targeting a posterior distribution defined on a large number of observations. Inspired by Approximate Bayesian Computation, we design a Markov chain whose transition makes use of an unknown but fixed, fraction of the available data, where the random choice of sub-sample is guided by the fidelity of this sub-sample to the observed data, as measured by summary (or sufficient) statistics. LWA-MCMC is a generic and flexible approach, as illustrated by the diverse set of examples which we explore. In each case LWA-MCMC yields excellent performance and in some cases a dramatic improvement compared to existing methodology.","cited_in":[],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227599998_Towards_a_coherent_statistical_framework_for_dense_deformable_template_estimation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243764505_Bayesian_Model_Choice_via_Markov_Chain_Monte_Carlo","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2453431_A_Sequential_Particle_Filter_Method_for_Static_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45910632_Constructing_Summary_Statistics_for_Approximate_Bayesian_ComputationSemi-automatic_ABC","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38322292_An_Adaptive_Metropolis_Algorithm","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41706878_Coupling_a_stochastic_approximation_version_of_EM_with_a_MCMC_procedure","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/27468515_An_efficient_MCMC_method_for_distributions_with_intractable_normalising_constants","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272027397_Calibration_of_conditional_composite_likelihood_for_Bayesian_inference_on_Gibbs_random_fields","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261065488_Noisy_Monte_Carlo_Convergence_of_Markov_chains_with_approximate_transition_kernels","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261065671_Firefly_Monte_Carlo_Exact_MCMC_with_subsets_of_data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227522317_Particle_Markov_Chain_Monte_Carlo","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/47297856_On_Optimal_Selection_of_Summary_Statistics_for_Approximate_Bayesian_Computation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/10652634_Beaumont_MA_Estimation_of_population_growth_or_decline_in_genetically_monitored_populations_Genetics_164_1139-1160","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8211096_A_Bayesian_MCMC_approach_to_study_transmission_of_Influenza_application_to_household_longitudinal_data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24168169_The_pseudo-marginal_approach_for_effcient_Monte_Carlo_computations","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2544726_Markov_Chain_Monte_Carlo_Estimation_of_Exponential_Random_Graph_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4772293_Exact_and_computationally_efficient_likelihood-based_estimation_for_discretely_observed_diffusion_processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236235190_Austerity_in_MCMC_Land_Cutting_the_Metropolis-Hastings_Budget","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200622065_Equation_of_State_Calculations_by_Fast_Computing_Machines","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228381228_Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo_algorithms_for_the_Bayesian_analysis_of_phylogenetic_trees","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239524417_Playing_Russian_Roulette_with_Intractable_Likelihoods","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/48178234_Approximate_Bayesian_Computational_methods","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2670104_Reversible_Jum_Markov_Chain_Monte_Carlo_Computation_and_Bayesian_Model_Determination","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/44617137_Approximate_Bayesian_Computation_ABC_in_practice","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/10899818_Corander_JC_Waldmann_P_Sillanpaa_MJ_Bayesian_anlysis_of_genetic_differentiation_between_populations_Genetics_163_367-374","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228092010_MCMC_for_doubly-intractable_distributions"]}
