{"id":289367841,"title":"On the Importance of Sluggish State Memory for Learning Long Term Dependency","authors":["Jonathan Tepper","Mahmud S. Shertil","Heather Powell"],"_abstract":"The vanishing gradients problem inherent in Simple Recurrent Networks (SRN) trained with back-propagation, has led to a significant shift towards the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Echo State Networks (ESN), which overcome this problem through either second order error-carousel schemes or different learning algorithms, respectively.","cited_in":[],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220233497_Learn_more_by_training_less_Systematicity_in_sentence_processing_by_recurrent_networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5583935_Learning_Long-Term_Dependencies_with_Gradient_Descent_Is_Difficult","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11050944_Connectionist_natural_language_parsing","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220233729_A_corpus-based_connectionist_architecture_for_large-scale_natural_language_parsing","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/253311448_Connectionist_psycholinguistics_in_perspective","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220549427_Syntactic_systematicity_in_sentence_processing_with_a_recurrent_self-organizing_network","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/10832640_On_Temporal_Generalization_of_Simple_Recurrent_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/10862955_Kalman_filters_improve_LSTM_network_performance_in_problems_unsolvable_by_traditional_recurrent_nets","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222148710_On_the_implicit_acquisition_of_a_context-free_grammar_by_a_simple_recurrent_neural_network","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224647818_Minimum_mean_squared_error_time_series_classification_using_an_echo_state_network_prediction_model","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236689333_Whatever_Next_Predictive_Brains_Situated_Agents_and_the_Future_of_Cognitive_Science","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/47791151_Minimum_complexity_echo_state_network_IEEE_Trans_Neural_Netw","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2789374_Using_Sampling_and_Queries_to_Extract_Rules_from_Trained_Neural_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220343676_Graded_State_Machines_The_Representation_of_Temporal_Contingencies_in_Simple_Recurrent_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2408996_How_Embedded_Memory_in_Recurrent_Neural_Network_Architectures_Helps_Learning_Long-term_Dependencies","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13606843_Can_connectionism_save_contructivism","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235403222_Real-Time_Parallel_Processing_of_Grammatical_Structure_in_the_Fronto-Striatal_System_A_Recurrent_Network_Simulation_Study_Using_Reservoir_Computing","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38036684_The_Myth_of_Language_Universals_Language_Diversity_and_Its_Importance_for_Cognitive_Science","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/40025363_Temporal-Kernel_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/37623797_Context-free_and_context-sensitive_dynamics_in_recurrent_neural_networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220601187_Classification_of_temporal_sequences_via_prediction_using_the_simple_recurrent_neural_network","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215385037_The_echo_state_approach_to_analysing_and_training_recurrent_neural_networks-with_an_erratum_note'","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228392775_Analyzing_the_internal_representations_of_trained_neural_networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243767227_A_Model_of_Corticostriatal_Plasticity_for_Learning_Oculomotor_Associations_and_Sequences","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11830840_The_Magical_Number_4_in_Short-Term_Memory_A_Reconsideration_of_Mental_Storage_Capacity","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256309652_Tutorial_on_training_recurrent_neural_networks_covering_BPPT_RTRL_EKF_and_the_echo_state_network_approach","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227605581_A_Usage-Based_Approach_to_Recursion_in_Sentence_Processing","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2632283_Understanding_Neural_Networks_via_Rule_Extraction","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222482534_Turing_computability_with_neural_nets","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/47635248_A_neurodynamical_model_for_working_memory","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2713494_Multi-recurrent_Networks_for_Traffic_Forecasting","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284514502_Minimum_complexity_echo_state_network","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224768707_The_cortical_language_circuit_from_auditory_perception_to_sentence_comprehension_Trends_Cogn_Sci","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13853244_Long_Short-term_Memory","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2430965_The_Recurrent_Cascade-Correlation_Architecture","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283123420_A_Field_Guide_to_Dynamical_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2643100_Temporal_Sequence_Processing_using_Recurrent_SOM","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263242011_Distributed_Representations_Simple_Recurrent_Networks_And_Grammatical_Structure","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255736341_Recurrent_temporal_networks_and_language_acquisition-from_corticostriatal_neurophysiology_to_reservoir_computing","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2298002_Neural_Networks_for_Time
