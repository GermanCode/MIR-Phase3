{"id":263593840,"title":"Indirect robot model learning for tracking control","authors":["Botond Bocsi","Lehel Csat√≥","Jan Peters"],"_abstract":"ABSTRACT Learning task-space tracking control on redundant robot manipulators is an important but difficult problem. A main difficulty is the non-uniqueness of the solution: a task-space trajectory has multiple joint-space trajectories associated, therefore averaging over non-convex solution space needs to be done if treated as a regression problem. A second class of difficulties arise for those robots when the physical model is either too complex or even not available. In this situation machine learning methods may be a suitable alternative to classical approaches. We propose a learning framework for tracking control that is applicable for underactuated or non-rigid robots where an analytical physical model of the robot is unavailable. The proposed framework builds on the insight that tracking problems are well defined in the joint task- and joint-space coordinates and consequently predictions can be obtained via local optimization. Physical experiments show that state-of-the art accuracy can be achieved in both online and offline tracking control learning. Furthermore, we show that the presented method is capable of controlling underactuated robot architectures as well.","cited_in":[{"id":278016195,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278016195_Robust_and_Incremental_Robot_Learning_by_Imitation"},{"id":282888260,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282888260_EcoBotics_Advantages_and_challenges_of_building_a_bamboo_robot_arm"}],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7552580_Incremental_Online_Learning_in_High_Dimensions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220122582_Learning_to_Control_in_Operational_Space","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223963258_Kinematic_Bezier_Maps","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41781406_A_Unifying_View_of_Sparse_Approximate_Gaussian_Process_Regression","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4149998_Reaching_through_learned_forward_model","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221073372_Using_Model_Knowledge_for_Learning_Inverse_Dynamics","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268020044_Incremental_Support_Vector_Learning_Analysis_Implementation_and_Applications","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/216053681_Operational_space_control_A_theoretical_and_empirical_comparison","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41781559_Gaussian_Process_for_Machine_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268890185_Practical_Mathematical_Optimization_An_Introduction_to_Basic_Optimization_Theory_and_Classical_and_New_Gradient-Based_Algorithms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41782125_Structured_prediction_by_joint_kernel_support_estimation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320388_Large_Margin_Methods_for_Structured_and_Interdependent_Output_Variables","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41781813_Learning_to_Control_in_Operational_Space","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221069997_Inverse_Kinematics_Learning_by_Modular_Architecture_Neural_Networks_with_Performance_Prediction_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320356_Local_and_global_sparse_Gaussian_process_approximations","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/40498341_A_Bayesian_approach_to_on-line_learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227943284_Structured_Prediction_by_Joint_Kernel_Support_Estimation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260354454_Online_Kernel-Based_Learning_for_Task-Space_Tracking_Robot_Control","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320671_A_Unifying_View_of_Sparse_Approximate_Gaussian_Process_Regression","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3930157_Learning_inverse_kinematics","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254041058_Learning_tracking_control_with_forward_models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228715647_LIBSVM_A_library_for_support_vector_machines","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221063688_Learning_inverse_kinematics_with_structured_prediction","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226644654_Learning_Forward_Models_for_the_Operational_Space_Control_of_Redundant_Robots","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11500673_Sparse_On-Line_Gaussian_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220499623_Estimating_Support_of_a_High-Dimensional_Distribution","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/246348844_GNU_Scientific_Library_Reference_Manual","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221621725_Gaussian_Processes_in_Machine_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/203918300_Smola_A_Learning_with_Kernels_-_Support_Vector_Machines_Regularization_Optimization_and_Beyond_MIT_Press_Cambridge_MA","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2355653_Forward_Models_Supervised_Learning_with_a_Distal_Teacher","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221618434_Fast_Sparse_Gaussian_Process_Methods_The_Informative_Vector_Machine","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220122865_Operational_Space_Control_A_Theoretical_and_Empirical_Comparison"]}
