{"id":230786935,"title":"FastEx: Fast Clustering with Exponential Families","authors":["Amr Ahmed","Sujith Ravi","Shravan Narayanamurthy","Alex Smola"],"_abstract":"Clustering is a key component in any data analysis toolbox. Despite its importance, scalable algorithms often eschew rich statistical models in favor of simpler descriptions such as k-means clustering. In this paper we present a sampler, capable of estimating mixtures of exponential families. At its heart lies a novel proposal distribution using random projections to achieve high throughput in generating proposals, which is crucial for clustering models with large numbers of clusters.","cited_in":[{"id":51956848,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51956848_Dimension_Reduction_by_Random_Hyperplane_Tessellations"}],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215991424_Cover_trees_for_nearest_neighbor","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220416605_Graphical_Models_Exponential_Families_and_Variational_Inference","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5948829_Finding_Scientific_Topics","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228095627_Sparse_Stochastic_Inference_for_Latent_Dirichlet_allocation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200110604_Predictive_discrete_latent_factor_models_for_large_scale_dyadic_data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2928129_Correlation_Clustering_-_Minimizing_Disagreements_on_Arbitrary_Weighted_Graphs","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221591327_Similarity_Estimation_Techniques_from_Rounding_Algorithms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221023652_Google_News_Personalization_Scalable_Online_Collaborative_Filtering","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2457699_0878_approximation_algorithms_for_MAX_CUT_and_MAX_2-SAT_Proc_26th_ACM_Symp_Theory_Comput1994_422-431_Updated_as_Improved_approximation_algorithms_for_maximum_cut_and_satisfiability_problems_using_semi","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236736810_The_necessary_and_sufficient_conditions_for_consistency_in_the_empirical_risk_minimization_method","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41781414_Fast_Gaussian_Process_Regression_using_KD-Trees"]}
