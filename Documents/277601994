{"id":277601994,"title":"Encoder-Decoder Optimization for Brain-Computer Interfaces","authors":["Josh Merel","Donald M Pianto","John P Cunningham","Liam Paninski"],"_abstract":"ABSTRACT Neuroprosthetic brain-computer interfaces are systems that decode neural activity into useful control signals for effectors, such as a cursor on a computer screen. It has long been recognized that both the user and decoding system can adapt to increase the accuracy of the end effector. Co-adaptation is the process whereby a user learns to control the system in conjunction with the decoder adapting to learn the user's neural patterns. We provide a mathematical framework for co-adaptation and relate co-adaptation to the joint optimization of the user's control scheme (\"encoding model\") and the decoding algorithm's parameters. When the assumptions of that framework are respected, co-adaptation cannot yield better performance than that obtainable by an optimal initial choice of fixed decoder, coupled with optimal user learning. For a specific case, we provide numerical methods to obtain such an optimized decoder. We demonstrate our approach in a model brain-computer interface system using an online prosthesis simulator, a simple human-in-the-loop pyschophysics setup which provides a non-invasive simulation of the BCI setting. These experiments support two claims: that users can learn encoders matched to fixed, optimal decoders and that, once learned, our approach yields expected performance advantages.","cited_in":[],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11320690_Direct_Cortical_Control_of_3D_Neuroprosthetic_Devices","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13561258_Harris_C_M_Wolpert_D_M_Signal-dependent_noise_determines_motor_planning_Nature_394_780-784","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7416440_Bayesian_Population_Decoding_of_Motor_Cortical_Activity_Using_a_Kalman_Filter","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3328462_Robust_Coding_Over_Noisy_Overcomplete_Channels","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23560563_Functional_network_reorganization_during_learning_in_a_brain-computer_interface_paradigm_Proc_Natl_Acad_Sci_USA","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23994307_Learning_Algorithms_for_Human-Machine_Interfaces","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38081148_Comparison_of_brain-computer_interface_decoding_algorithms_in_open-loop_and_closed-loop_control","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237346907_Neural_control_of_computer_cursor_velocity_by_decoding_motor_cortical_spiking_activity_in_humans_with_tetraplegiaDisclosure_JPD_is_the_Chief_Scientific_Officer_and_a_director_of_Cyberkinetics_Neurotec","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/9003504_Learning_to_Control_a_Brain-Machine_Interface_for_Reaching_and_Grasping_by_Primates","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7614214_Remapping_Hand_Movements_in_a_Novel_Geometrical_Environment","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/47414864_A_closed-loop_human_simulator_for_investigating_the_role_of_feedback_control_in_brain-machine_interfaces","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51057104_Reversible_large-scale_modification_of_cortical_networks_during_neuroprosthetic_control_Nat_Neurosci","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/49701202_Learning_to_move_machines_with_the_mind","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/47793936_Efficient_Decoding_With_Steady-State_Kalman_Filter_in_Neural_Interface_Systems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51206543_Interfacing_With_the_Computational_Brain","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51470846_Characterization_of_Minimum_Error_Linear_Coding_with_Sensory_and_Neural_Noise","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26684717_Emergence_of_a_Stable_Cortical_Map_for_Neuroprosthetic_Control","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24022683_Coadaptive_Brain-Machine_Interface_via_Reinforcement_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221775798_Body_machine_interface_Remapping_motor_skills_after_spinal_cord_injury","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51644575_Adaptive_Decoding_for_Brain-Machine_Interfaces_Through_Bayesian_Parameter_Updates","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223977793_Behavioral_and_neural_correlates_of_visuomotor_adaptation_observed_through_a_brain-computer_interface_in_primary_motor_cortex","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51030949_Using_the_electrocorticographic_speech_network_to_control_a_brain-computer_interface_in_humans_J_Neural_Eng_83036004","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227857350_Neural_population_dynamics_during_reaching","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233410056_Stochastic_Optimal_Control_as_a_Theory_of_Brain-Machine_Interface_Operation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233419192_Efficient_Coding_of_Spatial_Information_in_the_Primate_Retina","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235387142_A_brain_machine_interface_control_algorithm_designed_from_a_feedback_control_perspective","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233537409_A_High-Performance_Neural_Prosthesis_Enabled_by_Control_Algorithm_Design","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235648295_Volitional_Control_of_Neural_Activity_Relies_on_the_Natural_Motor_Repertoire","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233913158_The_Body-Machine_Interface_A_New_Perspective_on_an_Old_Theme","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239946538_Dynamic_Analysis_of_Naive_Adaptive_Brain-Machine_Interfaces","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260120120_Self-recalibrating_classifiers_for_intracortical_brain-computer_interfaces","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260219069_A_reductionist_approach_to_the_analysis_of_learning_in_brain-computer_interfaces","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261519381_Motor_cortical_control_of_movement_speed_with_implications_for_brain-machine_interface_control","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265134049_Neural_constraints_on_learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263097748_Continuous_Closed-Loop_Decoder_Adaptation_with_a_Recursive_Maximum_Likelihood_Algorithm_Allows_for_Rapid_Performance_Acquisition_in_Brain-Machine_Interfaces","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269183337_Combining_Decoder_Design_and_Neural_Adaptation_in_Brain-Machine_Interfaces","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263293357_Closed-Loop_Decoder_Adaptation_Shapes_Neural_Plasticity_for_Skillful_Neuroprosthetic_Control","https://www.researchgate.net/publica
