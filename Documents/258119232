In manufacturing industries, it is currently also becoming a topic of high practical relevance. A well-known challenge in most model generation approaches is the correct reproduction of the dynamic behaviour of model elements, for example, buffering or control strategies. This problem is especially relevant in simulation-based manufacturing control. In such scenarios, simulation models need to reflect the current state and behaviour of the real system in a highly accurate way, otherwise its suggested control decisions may be inaccurate or even dangerous towards production goals. This paper introduces a novel methodology for approximating dynamic behaviour using artificial neural networks, rather than trying to determine exact representations. We suggest using neural networks in conjunction with traditional material flow simulation systems whenever a certain decision cannot be made ex ante in the model generation process due to insufficient knowledge about the behaviour of the real system. In such cases the decision is delegated to the neural network, which is connected to the simulation system at runtime. Training of the neural network is performed by observation of the real systems decision and based on the evaluation of data that can be gained through production data acquisition. Our approach has certain advantages compared to other approaches and is especially well suited in the context of on-line simulation and simulation-based operational decision support. We demonstrate the applicability of our methodology using a case study and report on performance results.","cited_in":[{"id":277959098,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277959098_Dropout_as_a_Bayesian_Approximation_Representing_Model_Uncertainty_in_Deep_Learning"},{"id":262279659,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262279659_From_COTS_Simulation_Software_to_an_Open-source_Platform_A_Use_Case_in_the_Medical_Device_Industry"}],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221527836_Simulation-based_early_warning_systems_as_a_practical_approach_for_the_automotive_industry","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220366626_Discovering_Dispatching_Rules_Using_Data_Mining","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221526235_Preventive_what-if_analysis_in_symbiotic_simulation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222380566_Deterministic_Job-Shop_Scheduling_Past_Present_and_Future","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237536258_Neural_Network_Based_Priority_Assignment_for_Job_Scheduler","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221525158_On-line_data_processing_in_simulation_models_new_approaches_and_possibilities_through_HLA","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241184799_Approximation_of_Dispatching_Rules_in_Manufacturing_Control_Using_Artificial_Neural_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228444185_Initialization_of_simulation_models_using_CMSD","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229042446_A_Real_World_Pilot_Implementation_of_the_Core_Manufacturing_Simulation_Data_Model","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224366872_Identification_of_implicit_strategies_in_production_control","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221113090_Challenges_for_the_automatic_generation_of_simulation_models_for_production_systems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45200126_Local-Learning-Based_Feature_Selection_for_High-Dimensional_Data_Analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/35172449_Entwicklung_von_Methoden_zur_automatischen_Simulationsmodellgenerierung","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215721451_Neural_Networks_For_Pattern_Recognition","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271526843_MATLAB_The_language_of_technical_computing","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265146345_Fast_Artificial_Neural_Network_Library","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221117823_Symbiotic_Simulation_Systems_An_Extended_Definition_Motivated_by_Symbiosis_in_Biology","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225017349_Scheduling_Theory_Algorithms_And_Systems"]}
