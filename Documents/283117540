{"id":283117540,"title":"A 'Gibbs-Newton' Technique for Enhanced Inference of Multivariate Polya Parameters and Topic Models","authors":["Osama Khalifa","David Wolfe Corne","Mike Chantler"],"_abstract":"ABSTRACT Hyper-parameters play a major role in the learning and inference process of latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). In order to begin the LDA latent variables learning process, these hyper-parameters values need to be pre-determined. We propose an extension for LDA that we call 'Latent Dirichlet allocation Gibbs Newton' (LDA-GN), which places non-informative priors over these hyper-parameters and uses Gibbs sampling to learn appropriate values for them. At the heart of LDA-GN is our proposed 'Gibbs-Newton' algorithm, which is a new technique for learning the parameters of multivariate Polya distributions. We report Gibbs-Newton performance results compared with two prominent existing approaches to the latter task: Minka's fixed-point iteration method and the Moments method. We then evaluate LDA-GN in two ways: (i) by comparing it with standard LDA in terms of the ability of the resulting topic models to generalize to unseen documents; (ii) by comparing it with standard LDA in its performance on a binary classification task.","cited_in":[],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226878517_Combining_Stochastic_Block_Models_and_Mixed_Membership_for_Statistical_Network_Analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221353226_Contributions_to_the_study_of_SMS_spam_filtering_new_collection_and_results","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228884043_On_smoothing_and_inference_for_topic_models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2832818_Matching_Words_and_Pictures","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220846823_Latent_dirichlet_allocation_in_web_spam_filtering","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220319974_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221319876_Estimating_Likelihoods_for_Topic_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229157546_Applying_Discrete_PCA_in_Data_Analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/246764833_Marginal_Likelihood_from_the_Gibbs_Output","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4993330_Sequential_Monte_Carlo_Samplers","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233165299_Small_Sample_Comparison_of_Estimation_Methods_for_the_Beta_Distribution","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51233247_Describing_disability_through_individual-level_mixture_models_for_multivariate_binary_data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221364059_A_Bayesian_Hierarchical_Model_for_Learning_Natural_Scene_Categories","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5948829_Finding_Scientific_Topics","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221038091_The_first_text_retrieval_conference_TREC-1","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228092206_Stochastic_Variational_Inference","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220017593_Probabilistic_Latent_Semantic_Indexing","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265800992_Multi-Objective_Topic_Modeling","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229100259_Estimation_for_Dirichlet_Mixed_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/244507428_The_Collapsed_Gibbs_Sampler_in_Bayesian_Computations_with_Applications_to_a_Gene_Regulation_Problem","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2267464_A_Hierarchical_Dirichlet_Language_Model","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220017648_MALLET_A_machine_learning_for_language_toolkit","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224877317_Equation_of_State_Calculations_by_Fast_Computing_Machines","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221650814_Spam_Filtering_with_Naive_Bayes_-_Which_Naive_Bayes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2850032_Expectation-Propagation_for_the_Generative_Aspect_Model","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239062248_Estimating_a_Dirichlet_distribution","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230667658_Collective_Classification_for_Text_Classification","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2306327_Annealed_Importance_Sampling","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235789886_Approximate_Bayesian_Inference_by_the_Weighted_Likelihood_Bootstrap","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12483622_STRUCTURE_version_233_inference_of_population_structure_using_multilocus_genotype_data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233076115_Maximum_likelihood_estimation_of_Dirichlet_distributions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4246240_Using_Multiple_Segmentations_to_Discover_Objects_and_their_Extent_in_Image_Collections","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228754044_A_Memory-Based_Approach_to_Anti-Spam_Filtering","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229100600_Structured_Topic_Models_for_Language","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221618817_Rethinking_LDA_Why_priors_matter"]}
