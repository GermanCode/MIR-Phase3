{"id":281809119,"title":"Learning Social Relation Traits from Face Images","authors":["Zhanpeng Zhang","Ping Luo","Chen Change Loy","Xiaoou Tang"],"_abstract":"Social relation defines the association, e.g, warm, friendliness, and dominance, between two or more people. Motivated by psychological studies, we investigate if such fine-grained and high-level relation traits can be characterised and quantified from face images in the wild. To address this challenging problem we propose a deep model that learns a rich face representation to capture gender, expression, head pose, and age-related attributes, and then performs pairwise-face reasoning for relation prediction. To learn from heterogeneous attribute sources, we formulate a new network architecture with a bridging layer to leverage the inherent correspondences among these datasets. It can also cope with missing target attribute labels. Extensive experiments show that our approach is effective for fine-grained social relation learning in images and videos.","cited_in":[],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221304868_Training_Hierarchical_Feed-Forward_Visual_Recognition_Models_Using_Transfer_Learning_from_Pseudo-Tasks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221620245_Signature_Verification_Using_a_Siamese_Time_Delay_Neural_Network","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262352250_Discovering_informative_social_subgraphs_and_predicting_pairwise_relationships_from_group_photos","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223134705_Human_Behavior_Analysis_in_Video_Surveillance_a_Social_Signal_Processing_Perspective","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221304440_Learning_Relations_among_Movie_Characters_A_Social_Network_Perspective","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221110012_Inferring_social_relations_from_visual_concepts","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200026316_Analysing_Discourse_Textual_Analysis_for_Social_Research_London_Routledge","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261283556_Social_Interactions_A_First-Person_Perspective","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240237253_Facial_Expressions_During_Marital_Conflict","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268619657_Matrix_Variate_Distributions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227144874_The_Influence_of_Facial_Emotion_Displays_Gender_and_Ethnicity_on_Judgments_of_Dominance_and_Affiliation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41387160_Using_Audio_and_Video_Features_to_Classify_the_Most_Dominant_Person_in_a_Group_Meeting","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232282360_The_1982_Interpersonal_Circle_A_Taxonomy_for_Complementarity_in_Human_Transactions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227337361_Facial_expressions_of_emotion_influence_interpersonal_trait_inferences","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262274828_Learning_Human_Interaction_by_Interactive_Phrases","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221430174_Annotated_Facial_Landmarks_in_the_Wild_A_large-scale_real-world_database_for_facial_landmark_localization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261283566_Social_Roles_in_Hierarchical_Models_for_Human_Activity_Recognition","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268988287_Deep_Learning_Face_Attributes_in_the_Wild","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261336894_Hierarchical_face_parsing_via_deep_learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262396110_A_Deep_Sum-Product_Architecture_for_Robust_Facial_Attributes_Analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262208440_Dynamic_Probabilistic_CCA_for_Analysis_of_Affective_Behaviour","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254900623_Social_Signal_Processing_The_Research_Agenda","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45937203_Inferring_competitive_role_patterns_in_reality_TV_show_through_nonverbal_analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261248621_Social_Role_Discovery_in_Human_Events","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262365537_Hybrid_Deep_Learning_for_Face_Verification","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263564119_DeepFace_Closing_the_Gap_to_Human-Level_Performance_in_Face_Verification","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237000269_Deep_Learning_using_Linear_Support_Vector_Machines","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222430190_Social_Signal_Processing_Survey_of_an_Emerging_Domain","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229038870_Bridging_the_Gap_Between_Social_Animal_and_Unsocial_Machine_A_Survey_of_Social_Signal_Processing","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221305137_Seeing_People_in_Social_Context_Recognizing_People_and_Social_Relationships","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224373993_RoleNet_Movie_Analysis_from_the_Perspective_of_Social_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261479309_Supervised_Descent_Method_and_Its_Applications_to_Face_Alignment","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262274394_Deep_Learning_Identity-Preserving_Face_Space"]}
