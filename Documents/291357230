Cauwenberghs"],"_abstract":"ABSTRACT Electroencephalographic (EEG) source-level analyses such as independent component analysis (ICA) have uncovered features related to human cognitive functions or artifactual activities. Among these methods, Online Recursive ICA (ORICA) has been shown to achieve fast convergence in decomposing high-density EEG data for real-time applications. However, its adaptation performance has not been fully explored due to the difficulty in choosing an appropriate forgetting factor: the weight applied to new data in a recursive update which determines the trade-off between the adaptation capability and convergence quality. This study proposes an adaptive forgetting factor for ORICA (adaptive ORICA) to learn and adapt to non-stationarity in the EEG data. Using a realistically simulated non-stationary EEG dataset, we empirically show adaptive forgetting factors outperform other commonly-used non-adaptive rules when underlying source dynamics are changing. Standard offline ICA can only extract a subset of the changing sources while adaptive ORICA can recover all. Applied to actual EEG data recorded from a task-switching experiments, adaptive ORICA can learn and re-learn the task-related components as they change. With an adaptive forgetting factor, adaptive ORICA can track non-stationary EEG sources, opening many new online applications in brain-computer interfaces and in monitoring of brain dynamics.","cited_in":[],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51233007_EEGLAB_SIFT_NFT_BCILAB_and_ERICA_new_tools_for_advanced_EEG_processing","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11087365_On-line_learning_in_changing_environments_with_applications_in_supervised_and_unsupervised_learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/49627413_Finding_Stationary_Brain_Sources_in_EEG_Data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285351459_Methods_of_analysis_of_nonstationary_EEGs_with_emphasis_on_segmentation_techniques_a_comparative_review","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261211497_Recursive_independent_component_analysis_for_online_blind_source_separation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270658476_Online_recursive_independent_component_analysis_for_real-time_source_separation_of_high-density_EEG","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3322862_Robust_neural_networks_with_on-line_learning_for_blind_identification_and_blind_separation_of_sources_IEEE_Trans_Circ_Syst_Fund_Theor_Appl","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220361815_Natural_gradient-based_recursive_least-squares_algorithm_for_adaptive_blind_source_separation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224333214_A_Robust_Variable_Forgetting_Factor_Recursive_Least-Squares_Algorithm_for_System_Identification","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/253467874_Adaptive_Filtering_with_Averaging","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2433873_Natural_Gradient_Works_Efficiently_in_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256201309_BCILAB_A_platform_for_brain-computer_interface_development"]}
