{"id":267155572,"title":"Automatic Behaviour Understanding in Medicine","authors":["Michel Valstar"],"_abstract":"ABSTRACT Now that Affective Computing and Social Signal Process-ing methods are becoming increasingly robust and accu-rate, novel areas of applications with significant societal im-pact are opening up for exploration. Perhaps one of the most promising areas is the application of automatic expres-sive behaviour understanding to help diagnose, monitor, and treat medical conditions that themselves alter a person's so-cial and affective signals. This work argues that this is now essentially a new area of research, called behaviomedics. It gives a definition of the area, discusses the most important groups of medical conditions that could benefit from this, and makes suggestions for future directions.","cited_in":[{"id":275261019,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275261019_Open_Challenges_in_Modelling_Analysis_and_Synthesis_of_Human_Behaviour_in_Human-Human_and_Human-Machine_Interactions"},{"id":271372732,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271372732_Recognizing_an_Individual_their_Topic_of_Conversation_and_Cultural_Background_from_3D_Body_Movement"},{"id":272142354,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272142354_Recognizing_an_Individual_their_Topic_of_Conversation_and_Cultural_Background_from_3D_Body_Movement"},{"id":275259777,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275259777_Objective_Methods_for_Reliable_Detection_of_Concealed_Depression"},{"id":276273424,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276273424_Suitability_of_a_low_cost_system_for_quantitative_motion_capture_applications"}],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236017807_Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders_DSM-V","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8157458_The_Hamilton_Depression_Rating_Scale_Has_the_Gold_Standard_Become_a_Lead_Weight","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261032964_Automatic_Decoding_of_Facial_Movements_Reveals_Deceptive_Pain_Expressions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/19253125_The_Psychopathology_of_Affects_Conceptual_and_Historical_Aspects","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258713575_Automated_Detection_of_Pain_from_Facial_Expressions_A_Rule-Based_Approach_Using_AAM","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224172364_Advances_in_Behavioral_Science_Using_Automated_Facial_Image_Analysis_and_Synthesis_Social_Sciences","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224088064_Detecting_depression_from_facial_actions_and_vocal_prosody","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/19171615_Facial_Expression_During_Induced_Pain","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233600178_Towards_Interactive_Robots_in_Autism_Therapy_Background_Motivation_and_Challenges","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260562140_Social_Risk_and_Depression_Evidence_from_Manual_and_Automatic_Facial_Expression_Analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/29857038_Pain_Psychological_perspectives","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/17106538_Development_of_a_Rating_Scale_for_Primary_Depressive_Illness","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51479049_Automated_Facial_Action_Coding_System_for_dynamic_analysis_of_facial_expressions_in_neuropsychiatric_disorders","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262162740_Automatic_detection_of_pain_intensity","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221568776_Designing_Capture_Applications_to_Support_the_Education_of_Children_with_Autism","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221652173_Analysis_of_speech_properties_of_neurotypicals_and_individuals_diagnosed_with_autism_and_down","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232574161_Development_of_an_observation_method_for_assessing_pain_behavior_in_chronic_low_back_patients","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247796415_Melancholia_A_Historical_Review","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221292544_Painful_data_The_UNBC-McMaster_shoulder_pain_expression_archive_database","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220721109_A_medical_mirror_for_non-contact_health_monitoring","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24178821_Assessing_pain_by_facial_expression_Facial_expression_as_nexus","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238307129_Expressing_pain_The_communication_and_interpretation_of_facial_pain_signals","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261115617_Transfer_learning_to_account_for_idiosyncrasy_in_face_and_body_expressions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256309420_Automatic_Behavior_Descriptors_for_Psychological_Disorder_Analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256309112_Automatic_Nonverbal_Behavior_Indicators_of_Depression_and_PTSD_Exploring_Gender_Differences","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6926542_The_influence_of_communication_goals_and_physical_demands_on_different_dimensions_of_pain_behavior","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262157517_AVEC_2013_-_The_continuous_AudioVisual_Emotion_and_depression_recognition_challenge","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5801619_Automated_video-based_facial_expression_analysis_of_neuropsychiatric_disorders","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266654758_Vocal_biomarkers_of_depression_based_on_motor_incoordination","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8364682_A_Review_of_Studies_of_the_Hamilton_Depression_Rating_Scale_in_Healthy_Controls"]}
