{"id":267759898,"title":"Validation of Network Reconciliation","authors":["Ya Le","Eric Bax","Nicola Barbieri","David Garc√≠a-Soriano","Jitesh Mehta","James Li"],"_abstract":"ABSTRACT Network reconciliation is the problem of identifying nodes in separate networks that represent the same entity, for example matching nodes across social networks that correspond to the same user. We introduce a technique to compute probably approximately correct (PAC) bounds on precision and recall for network reconciliation algorithms. The bounds require some verified matches, but those matches may be used to develop the algorithms. The bounds do not require knowledge of the network generation process, and they can supply confidence levels for individual matches.","cited_in":[],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271554241_A_Bayesian_method_for_matching_two_similar_graphs_without_seeds","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/246546930_An_efficient_reconciliation_algorithm_for_social_networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228057769_Probability_Inequalities_for_Sums_of_Bounded_Random_Variables","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38015401_A_Path_Following_Algorithm_for_the_Graph_Matching_Problem","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247093571_PAC-Bayesian_statistical_learning_theory","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239546749_Statistical_Learning_Theory","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3770656_Fibonacci_Heaps_And_Their_Uses_In_Improved_Network_Optimization_Algorithms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2860041_Tutorial_on_Practical_Prediction_Theory_for_Classification","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267128815_Concentration_inequalities_A_nonasymptotic_theory_of_independence","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264954908_The_Graph_Isomorphism_Problem_its_structural_complexity","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256606492_Concentration_inequalities_for_sampling_without_replacement","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254006546_Resolving_user_identities_over_social_networks_through_supervised_learning_and_rich_similarity_features","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45863486_Empirical_Bernstein_Bounds_and_Sample_Variance_Penalization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2640094_Fast_and_Accurate_Computation_of_Binomial_Probabilities","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258128848_On_the_Performance_of_Percolation_Graph_Matching","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4330790_TALE_A_tool_for_approximate_large_graph_matching","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221996154_Probability_Inequalities_For_Sums_of_Bounded_Random_Variables","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262524340_Graph_matching_and_learning_in_Pattern_Recognition_in_the_last_10_years"]}
