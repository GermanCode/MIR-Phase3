We analyze both the classical bounded-importance-weight condition and a more recent moment condition. We show that Gaussian importance distributions based on Laplace approximations or non-linear Kalman filters lead to particle filters that are not guaranteed to converge. We also suggest avoiding the problem by a certain split-Gaussian modification that naturally arises from ensuring bounded weights. Although in this paper we concentrate on the time-varying Poisson regression model, we argue that our findings have implications in more general particle filtering problems.","cited_in":[],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38339872_Central_limit_theorem_for_nonlinear_filtering_and_interacting_particle_systems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287422283_Weight_moment_conditions_for_L4_convergence_of_particle_filters_for_unbounded_test_functions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3318241_A_Survey_of_Convergence_Results_on_Particle_Filtering_Methods_for_Practitioners","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4895745_Bayesian_Inference_in_Econometric_Models_Using_Monte_Carlo_Integration","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3319722_Quasi-Monte_Carlo_filtering_in_nonlinear_dynamic_systems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286119652_On_the_L4_convergence_of_particle_filters_with_general_importance_distributions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267173362_Fundamentals_of_Stochastic_Filtering","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5097550_The_Multivariate_Split_Normal_Distribution_and_Asymmetric_Principal_Components_Analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224718050_Sampling_Densities_of_Particle_Filter_A_Survey_and_Comparison","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200744518_Sequential_Monte-Carlo_Methods_in_Practice","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233990793_Feynman-Kac_Formulae_Genealogical_and_Interacting_Particle_Systems_With_Applications","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236853542_Inference_in_Hidden_Markov_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2559189_On_Sequential_Monte_Carlo_Sampling_Methods_for_Bayesian_Filtering","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2453711_The_Unscented_Particle_Filter","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2439039_Convergence_of_Sequential_Monte_Carlo_Methods","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267433994_Mean_Field_Simulation_for_Monte_Carlo_Integration","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259390620_Bayesian_Filtering_and_Smoothing","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261181662_Moment_Conditions_for_Convergence_of_Particle_Filters_with_Unbounded_Importance_Weights","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235335123_Assessment_of_Mortgage_Default_Risk_via_Bayesian_State_Space_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224227034_A_General_Convergence_Result_for_Particle_Filtering","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3361206_Novel_Approach_to_NonlinearNon-Gaussian_Bayesian_State_Estimation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3320747_A_Basic_Convergence_Result_for_Particle_Filtering"]}
