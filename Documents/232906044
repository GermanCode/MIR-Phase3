{"id":232906044,"title":"Kernelized Bayesian Matrix Factorization","authors":["Mehmet GÃ¶nen","Suleiman A Khan","Samuel Kaski"],"_abstract":"ABSTRACT We extend kernelized matrix factorization with a fully Bayesian treatment and with an ability to work with multiple side information sources expressed as different kernels. Kernel functions have been introduced to matrix factorization to integrate side information about the rows and columns (e.g., objects and users in recommender systems), which is necessary for making out-of-matrix (i.e., cold start) predictions. We discuss specifically bipartite graph inference, where the output matrix is binary, but extensions to more general matrices are straightforward. We extend the state of the art in two key aspects: (i) A fully conjugate probabilistic formulation of the kernelized matrix factorization problem enables an efficient variational approximation, whereas fully Bayesian treatments are not computationally feasible in the earlier approaches. (ii) Multiple side information sources are included, treated as different kernels in multiple kernel learning that additionally reveals which side information sources are informative. Our method outperforms alternatives in predicting drug-protein interactions on two data sets. We then show that our framework can also be used for solving multilabel learning problems by considering samples and labels as the two domains where matrix factorization operates on. Our algorithm obtains the lowest Hamming loss values on 10 out of 14 multilabel classification data sets compared to five state-of-the-art multilabel learning algorithms.","cited_in":[{"id":269721692,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269721692_MORES_Online_Incremental_Multiple-Output_Regression_for_Data_Streams"},{"id":264091340,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264091340_Integrative_and_Personalized_QSAR_Analysis_in_Cancer_by_Kernelized_Bayesian_Matrix_Factorization"},{"id":269933204,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269933204_General_Dimensional_Multiple-Output_Support_Vector_Regressions_and_Their_Multiple_Kernel_Learning"},{"id":279992062,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279992062_Deciding_when_to_stop_Efficient_experimentation_to_learn_to_predict_drug-target_interactions"},{"id":274729851,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274729851_Deciding_when_to_stop_Efficient_stopping_of_active_learning_guided_drug-target_prediction"},{"id":291418853,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291418853_A_multiple_kernel_learning_algorithm_for_drug-target_interaction_prediction"}],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240191894_Probabilistic_Sparse_Matrix_Factorization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23162382_Development_and_Validation_of_AMANDA_a_New_Algorithm_for_Selecting_Highly_Relevant_Regions_in_Molecular_Interaction_Fields","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12291808_VolSurf_A_new_tool_for_pharmacokinetic_optimization_of_lead_compounds","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242530111_Bayesian_Analysis_of_Binary_and_Polychotomous_Response_Data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220698959_Link_Prediction_via_Matrix_Factorization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41166614_Sparse_partial_least_squares_for_simultaneous_dimension_reduction_and_variable_selection","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221345785_Bayesian_probabilistic_matrix_factorization_using_Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221345336_Non-linear_matrix_factorization_with_Gaussian_processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257618460_A_comparative_evaluation_of_stochastic-based_inference_methods_for_Gaussian_process_models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2320571_Gaussian_Processes_for_Regression","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236916461_Automatic_Relevance_Determination_in_Nonnegative_Matrix_Factorization_with_the_beta-Divergence","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225080187_Comprehensive_data-driven_analysis_of_the_impact_of_chemoinformatic_structure_on_the_genome-wide_biological_response_profiles_of_cancer_cells_to_1159_drugs","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45921723_Slice_sampling_covariance_hyperparameters_of_latent_Gaussian_models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11063283_Lee_TI_et_al_Transcriptional_regulatory_networks_in_Saccharomyces_cerevisiae_Science_298_799-804","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220765804_Generalized_Probabilistic_Matrix_Factorizations_for_Collaborative_Filtering","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221619721_Variational_Gaussian-process_factor_analysis_for_modeling_spatio-temporal_data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/44655667_Drug-target_interaction_prediction_from_chemical_genomic_and_pharmacological_data_in_an_integrated_framework","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13443305_Spellman_PT_Sherlock_G_Zhang_MQ_Iyer_VR_Anders_K_Eisen_MB_et_al_Comprehensive_identification_of_cell_cycle-regulated_genes_of_the_yeast_Saccharomyces_cerevisiae_by_microarray_hybridization_Mol_Biol_Ce","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220814347_On_Multiple_Kernel_Learning_with_Multiple_Labels","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5386566_Nonnegative_Matrix_Factorization_with_Gaussian_Process_Priors","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221654332_Collaborative_topic_modeling_for_recommending_scientific_articles","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225120531_Bayesian_Matrix_Co-Factorization_Variational_Algorithm_and_Cramer-Rao_Bound","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/34000771_Variational_algorithms_for_approximate_Bayesian_inference","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221619768_A_Kernel_Method_for_Multi-Labelled_Classification","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221344836_Hierarchic_Bayesian_models_for_kernel_learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221519967_fLDA_Matrix_factorization_through_latent_dirichlet_allocation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221620080_Relational_Learning_with_Gaussian_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265623949_Kernelized_Probabilistic_Matrix_Factorization_Exploiting_Graphs_and_Side_Information","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7782794_Kernel_Methods_for_Predicting_Protein-Protein_Interactions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5473196_Girolami_M_Probabilistic_multi-class_multi-kernel_learning_On_protein_fold_recognition_and_remote_homology_detection_Bioinformatics_2410_1264-1270","https://www.researchgate.net/publication
