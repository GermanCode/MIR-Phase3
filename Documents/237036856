{"id":237036856,"title":"A spatially-constrained normalized Gamma process prior","authors":["Sotirios P Chatzis","Dimitrios Korkinof","Yiannis Demiris"],"_abstract":"ABSTRACT In this work, we propose a novel nonparametric Bayesian method for clustering of data with spatial inter-dependencies. Specifically, we devise a novel normalized Gamma process, regulated by a simplified (pointwise) Markov random field (Gibbsian) distribution with a countably infinite number of states. As a result of its construction, the proposed model allows for introducing spatial dependencies in the clus-tering mechanics of the normalized Gamma process, thus yielding a novel nonparametric Bayesian method for spatial data clustering. We derive an efficient truncated variational Bayesian algorithm for model inference. We examine the efficacy of our approach by considering an image segmentation appli-cation using a real-world dataset. We show that our approach outperforms related methods from the field of Bayesian nonparametrics, including the infinite hidden Markov random field model, and the Dirichlet process prior.","cited_in":[{"id":260521748,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260521748_Image_segmentation_by_Dirichlet_process_mixture_model_with_generalised_mean"}],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/35336839_Mixtures_of_Dirichlet_processes_with_applications_to_Bayesian_nonparametric_problems_microform","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221346155_Variational_methods_for_the_Dirichlet_process","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254212736_Variational_inference_for_Dirichlet_process_mixtures_Bayesian_Anal_1121-144","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38357646_Ferguson_Distributions_Via_Polya_Urn_Schemes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223013541_An_iterative_Gibbsian_technique_for_reconstruction_of_m-ary_images","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/44572779_The_Infinite_Hidden_Markov_Random_Field_Model","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221995544_Bishop_CM_Pattern_Recognition_and_Machine_Learning_Springer","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224327452_A_Fuzzy_Clustering_Approach_Toward_Hidden_Markov_Random_Field_Models_for_Enhanced_Spatially_Constrained_Image_Segmentation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224881748_Variational_Methods_for_the_Dirichlet_Process","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2490131_Classifying_Images_of_Materials_Achieving_Viewpoint_and_Illumination_Independence","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220939223_Measures_of_Similarity","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51386846_A_Class-Adaptive_Spatially_Variant_Mixture_Model_for_Image_Segmentation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3320514_Music_Analysis_Using_Hidden_Markov_Mixture_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220501639_Mean_field_theory_in_EM_procedures_for_blind_Markov_random_field_image_restoration","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3320517_Signal_Modeling_and_Classification_Using_a_Robust_Latent_Space_Model_Based_on_Distributions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234363825_Introduction_to_Modem_Statistical_Mechanics","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261021839_The_Infinite_Hidden_Markov_Random_Field_Model","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38326987_Nonparametric_Bayesian_Data_Analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4993246_Bayesian_Nonparametric_Inference_for_Random_Distributions_and_Related_Functions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225797350_Nonparametric_Bayesian_Image_Segmentation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222396384_EM_Procedures_Using_Mean_Field-Like_Approximations_for_Markov_Model-Based_Image_Segmentation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4207400_A_Measure_for_Objective_Evaluation_of_Image_Segmentation_Algorithms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220323155_The_Mean_Field_Theory_in_EM_Procedures_for_Markov_Random_Fields","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226435002_An_Introduction_to_Variational_Methods_for_Graphical_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/37597291_Probabilistic_Solution_of_Ill-Posed_Problems_in_Computational_Vision","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38357862_Antoniak_CE_Mixtures_of_Dirichlet_Processes_with_Applications_to_Bayesian_Nonparametric_Problems_Ann_Stat_2_1152-1174","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220182914_Geman_D_Stochastic_relaxation_Gibbs_distribution_and_the_Bayesian_restoration_of_images_IEEE_Trans_Pattern_Anal_Mach_Intell_PAMI-66_721-741","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3906161_A_Database_of_Human_Segmented_Natural_Images_and_its_Application_to_Evaluating_Segmentation_Algorithms_and_Measuring_Ecological_Statistics_EECS_Department_University_of_California_Berkeley","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259014834_Estimation_of_Parameters_in_Hidden_Markov_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229100346_Markov_Chain_Sampling_Methods_for_Dirichlet_Process_Mixture_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38357634_A_Bayesian_Analysis_of_Some_Non-Parametric_Problems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220501286_A_Class-Adaptive_Spatially_Variant_Mixture_Model_for_Image_Segmentation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229100417_A_Constructive_Definition_of_the_Dirichlet_Prior"]}
