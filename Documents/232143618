{"id":232143618,"title":"Risk-Sensitive Mean Field Games","authors":["Hamidou Tembine","Quanyan Zhu","Tamer Ba≈üar"],"_abstract":"ABSTRACT In this paper, we study a class of risk-sensitive mean-field stochastic differential games. We show that under appropriate regularity conditions, the mean-field value of the stochastic differential game with exponentiated integral cost functional coincides with the value function described by a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation with an additional quadratic term. We provide an explicit solution of the mean-field best response when the instantaneous cost functions are log-quadratic and the state dynamics are affine in the control. An equivalent mean-field risk-neutral problem is formulated and the corresponding mean-field equilibria are characterized in terms of backward-forward macroscopic McKean-Vlasov equations, Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equations, and HJB equations. We provide numerical examples on the mean field behavior to illustrate both linear and McKean-Vlasov dynamics.","cited_in":[{"id":268747171,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268747171_Risk-Sensitive_Mean-Field-Type_Control_under_Partial_Observation"},{"id":284476296,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284476296_Mean-field-game_model_for_Botnet_defense_in_Cyber-security"},{"id":261286990,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261286990_A_Stochastic_Maximum_Principle_for_Risk-Sensitive_Mean-Field_Type_Control"},{"id":276257676,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276257676_LQ_Nash_Games_With_Random_Entrance_An_Infinite_Horizon_Major_Player_and_Minor_Players_of_Finite_Horizons"},{"id":268747178,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268747178_On_the_Solvability_of_Risk-Sensitive_Linear-Quadratic_Mean-Field_Games"},{"id":267454368,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267454368_A_game-theoretic_approach_to_dynamic_demand_response_management"},{"id":261322647,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261322647_A_Stochastic_Maximum_Principle_for_Risk-Sensitive_Mean-Field_Type_Control"},{"id":228523675,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228523675_Mean_field_stochastic_games_Convergence_QH-learning_and_optimality"},{"id":257800569,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257800569_Multi-Resolution_Large_Population_Stochastic_Differential_Games_and_Their_Application_to_Demand_Response_Management_in_the_Smart_Grid"},{"id":261767092,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261767092_Mean_Field_Games_Models-A_Brief_Survey"},{"id":260980300,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260980300_Mean-Field_Games_for_Marriage"},{"id":269137252,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269137252_Risk-sensitive_mean-field-type_games"},{"id":276239772,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276239772_Risk-Sensitive_Mean-Field-Type_Games_with_Lp-norm_Drifts"},{"id":279241732,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279241732_Robust_Mean_Field_Games"},{"id":278413377,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278413377_On_the_mean_field_games_with_common_noise_and_the_McKean-Vlasov_SPDEs"},{"id":279311925,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279311925_Indefinite_Mean-Field_Stochastic_Linear-Quadratic_Optimal_Control"},{"id":280062324,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280062324_Mean_field_game_model_of_corruption"},{"id":282411128,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282411128_Mean-Field_Game_Modeling_the_Bandwagon_Effect_with_Activation_Costs"},{"id":284244189,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284244189_Mean-Field-Game_Model_of_Corruption"},{"id":287332648,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287332648_partial_information"}],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/250311065_Mean_Field_Difference_Games_McKean-Vlasov_Dynamics","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3611260_Model_simplification_and_optimal_control_of_stochastic_singularly_perturbed_systems_under_exponentiated_quadratic_cost","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224367961_Oblivious_equilibrium_for_large-scale_stochastic_games_with_unbounded_costs","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254054924_Mean_field_difference_games_McKean-Vlasov_dynamics","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3032732_Emergent_Behavior_in_Flocks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4902810_Anonymous_Sequential_Games_with_Aggregate_Uncertainty","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247689715_Symmetric_Measures_on_Cartesian_Products","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260879816_Demonstration_of_two-beam_acceleration_and_30_GHz_power_production_in_the_CLIC_Test_Facility","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243766637_Dynamic_Non-Cooperative_Game_Theory","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38374863_Large_population_stochastic_dynamic_games_Closed-loop_McKean-Vlasov_systems_and_the_Nash_certainty_equivalence_principle","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/250611244_Risk-Sensitive_Mean_Field_Stochastic_Differential_Games","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221619617_Oblivious_Equilibrium_A_Mean_Field_Approximation_for_Large-Scale_Dynamic_Games","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239667005_Risk-Sensitive_LinearQuadratic_Gaussian_Control","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4057961_Individual_and_mass_behaviour_in_large_population_stochastic_wireless_power_control_problems_centralized_and_Nash_equilibrium_solutions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225705859_On_the_mathematics_of_emergence","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4906094_The_propagation_of_chaos_for_interacting_individuals_ina_large_population_Math_Soc_Sci","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224043867_Chemical_Oscillations_Waves_and_Turbulence_New_York_Springer-Verlag","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224162543_Synchronization_of_Coupled_Oscillators_is_a_Game","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3026771_Optimal_Stochastic_Linear_Sys
