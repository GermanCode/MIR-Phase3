{"id":260428846,"title":"Modeling the Complex Dynamics and Changing Correlations of Epileptic Events","authors":["Drausin F. Wulsin","Emily B. Fox","Brian Litt"],"_abstract":"ABSTRACT Patients with epilepsy can manifest short, sub-clinical epileptic \"bursts\" in addition to full-blown clinical seizures. We believe the relationship between these two classes of events---something not previously studied quantitatively---could yield important insights into the nature and intrinsic dynamics of seizures. A goal of our work is to parse these complex epileptic events into distinct dynamic regimes. A challenge posed by the intracranial EEG (iEEG) data we study is the fact that the number and placement of electrodes can vary between patients. We develop a Bayesian nonparametric Markov switching process that allows for (i) shared dynamic regimes between a variable numbers of channels, (ii) asynchronous regime-switching, and (iii) an unknown dictionary of dynamic regimes. We encode a sparse and changing set of dependencies between the channels using a Markov-switching Gaussian graphical model for the innovations process driving the channel dynamics and demonstrate the importance of this model in parsing and out-of-sample predictions of iEEG data. We show that our model produces intuitive state assignments that can help automate clinical analysis of seizures and enable the comparison of sub-clinical bursts and full clinical seizures.","cited_in":[{"id":281143829,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281143829_Microscale_Spatiotemporal_Dynamics_during_Neocortical_Propagation_of_Human_Focal_Seizures"},{"id":284729742,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284729742_Mining_continuous_intracranial_EEG_in_focal_canine_epilepsy_Relating_interictal_bursts_to_seizure_onsets"}],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265617070_Handbook_of_Markov_Chain_Monte_Carlo","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320063_The_Infinite_Hierarchical_Hidden_Markov_Model","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224056058_Line_length_An_efficient_feature_for_seizure_onset_detection","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220321339_Bayesian_Nonparametric_Inference_of_Switching_Dynamic_Linear_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2348531_On_Bayesian_analysis_of_mixture_with_unknown_number_of_components","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/44024149_Bayesian_nonparametric_learning_of_complex_dynamical_phenomena","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236157548_Factorial_Hidden_Markov_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45851769_A_sticky_HDP-HMM_with_application_to_speaker_diarization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221620193_Sharing_Features_among_Dynamical_Systems_with_Beta_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8012478_A_multi-feature_and_multichannel_univariate_selection_process_for_seizure_prediction_Clin_Neurophysiol_116_506-516","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11993102_Epileptic_Seizures_May_Begin_Hours_in_Advance_of_Clinical_Onset","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227661917_Green_PJ_On_Bayesian_analysis_of_mixtures_with_an_unknown_number_of_components_with_discussion_J_Roy_Stat_Soc_B_59_731-792","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/32896369_Hierarchical_Dirichlet_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38359812_Hyper_Markov_Laws_in_the_Statistical_Analysis_of_Decomposable_Graphical_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4742259_Hierarchical_Dirichlet_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220270203_Infinite_Latent_Feature_Models_and_the_Indian_Buffet_Process","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227688851_Exact_and_Approximate_Sum_Representations_for_the_Dirichlet_process","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2468910_New_Methods_of_Time_Series_Analysis_of_Non-Stationary_EEG_Data_Eigenstructure_Decompositions_of_Time_Varying_Autoregressions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6714965_Assessing_seizure_dynamics_by_analysing_the_correlation_structure_of_multichannel_intracranial_EEG","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7567245_Neuronal_Spatiotemporal_Pattern_Discrimination_The_Dynamical_Evolution_of_Seizures","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222520582_Multivariate_time_series_modeling_and_classification_via_hierarchical_VAR_mixtures","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2670104_Reversible_Jum_Markov_Chain_Monte_Carlo_Computation_and_Bayesian_Model_Determination","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232275992_Graph-Coupled_HMMs_for_Modeling_the_Spread_of_Infection","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51956642_Joint_Modeling_of_Multiple_Related_Time_Series_via_the_Beta_Process","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220321011_Hierarchical_Beta_Processes_and_the_Indian_Buffet_Process","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221345210_Beam_sampling_for_the_infinite_hidden_Markov_model","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38018800_Classification_of_patterns_of_EEG_synchronization_for_seizure_prediction","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5207554_Simulation_of_hyper-inverse_Wishart_distributions_in_graphical_models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267424196_Effective_Split-Merge_Monte_Carlo_Methods_for_Nonparametric_Models_of_Sequential_Data"]}
