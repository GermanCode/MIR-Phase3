{"id":220226884,"title":"Continuous-time and continuous-discrete-time unscented Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoothers","authors":["Simo Särkkä"],"_abstract":"ABSTRACT This article considers the application of the unscented transformation to approximate fixed-interval optimal smoothing of continuous-time non-linear stochastic dynamic systems. The proposed methodology can be applied to systems, where the dynamics can be modeled with non-linear stochastic differential equations and the noise corrupted measurements are obtained continuously or at discrete times. The smoothing algorithm is based on computing the continuous-time limit of the recently proposed unscented Rauch–Tung–Striebel smoother, which is an approximate optimal smoothing algorithm for discrete-time stochastic dynamic systems.","cited_in":[{"id":260347981,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260347981_SEQUENTIAL_MONTE_CARLO_METHODS_FOR_THE_CALIBRATION_OF_STOCHASTIC_RAINFALL-RUNOFF_MODELS"},{"id":224068714,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224068714_Dispersion-compensating_fiber_is_there_merit_in_the_figure_of_merit"},{"id":49844161,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/49844161_A_data-driven_framework_for_neural_field_modeling"},{"id":233560852,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233560852_Monocular_odometry_in_country_roads_based_on_phase-derived_optical_flow_and_4-DOF_ego-motion_model"},{"id":261489890,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261489890_On_H_fixed-interval_smoothing_for_linear_continuous_time-delay_systems"},{"id":227716489,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227716489_State-Space_Inference_for_Non-Linear_Latent_Force_Models_withApplication_to_Satellite_Orbit_Prediction"},{"id":256935229,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256935229_Square-root_quaternion_cubature_Kalman_filtering_for_spacecraft_attitude_estimation"},{"id":258794013,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258794013_H_infty_Fixed-Interval_Smoothing_Estimation_for_Time-Delay_Systems"},{"id":278693647,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278693647_Kalman_Smoothing_for_Distributed_Optimal_Feedback_Control_of_Unicycle_Formations"},{"id":256994072,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256994072_Gaussian_filtering_and_smoothing_for_continuous-discrete_dynamic_systems"},{"id":272017380,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272017380_Posterior_inference_on_parameters_of_stochastic_differential_equations_via_non-linear_Gaussian_filtering_and_adaptive_MCMC"},{"id":261312755,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261312755_Distributed_path_integral_feedback_control_based_on_Kalman_smoothing_for_unicycle_formations"},{"id":259390620,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259390620_Bayesian_Filtering_and_Smoothing"},{"id":272007454,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272007454_Stochastic_optimal_enhancement_of_distributed_formation_control_using_Kalman_smoothers"},{"id":269163571,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269163571_Parameter_Requirements_for_Non-Cooperative_Satellite_Maneuver_Reconstruction_Using_Adaptive_Filters"},{"id":273485916,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273485916_A_Systematization_of_the_Unscented_Kalman_Filter_Theory"},{"id":284184050,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284184050_A_Systematization_of_the_Unscented_Kalman_Filter_Theory"}],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215721589_Stochastic_Models_Estimation_and_Control_Vol_II","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227621957_The_Unscented_Kalman_Filter","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222784162_Rao-Blackwellized_particle_filter_for_multiple_target_tracking_Inf_Fusion_J_82-15","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3028808_Optimal_filtering","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/36142880_Recursive_Bayesian_inference_on_stochastic_differential_equations","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3033057_Unscented_Rauch--Tung--Striebel_Smoother","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230873432_Optimal_Control_And_Estimation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224334106_New_approach_to_filtering_for_nonlinear_systems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3114799_Estimation_Theory_with_Application_to_Communication_and_Control","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3115576_Stochastic_Optimal_Linear_Estimation_and_Control","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/250955751_On_the_Differential_Equations_Satisfied_by_Conditional_Probability_Densities_of_Markov_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3546085_Application_of_fixed_point_smoothing_to_the_calibration_alignment_and_navigation_data_of_inertial_navigation_systems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2986278_Unscented_Filtering_and_Nonlinear_Estimation_Proc_IEEE","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3917922_Monte_Carlo_smoothing_with_application_to_audio_signal_enhancement","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229439308_Maximum_Likelihood_Estimates_of_Linear_Dynamic_Systems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224839919_A_New_Approach_To_Linear_Filtering_and_Prediction_Problems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256123494_Fixed-lag_demodulation_of_discrete_noisy_measurements_of_FM_signals","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3024629_Nonlinear_Filtering_Theory","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/246868500_Monte_Carlo_filter_and_smoother_for_non-Gaussian_state_space_models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/202924343_Stochastic_Differential_Equations_An_Introduction_With_Applications","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/31151125_Conditional_Markov_Processes_and_their_application_to_the_Theory_of_Optimal_Control","https:
