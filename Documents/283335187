{"id":283335187,"title":"Blitzkriging: Kronecker-structured Stochastic Gaussian Processes","authors":["Thomas Nickson","Tom Gunter","Chris Lloyd","Michael A Osborne","Stephen Roberts"],"_abstract":"We present Blitzkriging, a new approach to fast inference for Gaussian processes, applicable to regression, optimisation and classification. State-of-the-art (stochastic) inference for Gaussian processes on very large datasets scales cubically in the number of 'inducing inputs', variables introduced to factorise the model. Blitzkriging shares state-of-the-art scaling with data, but reduces the scaling in the number of inducing points to approximately linear. Further, in contrast to other methods, Blitzkriging: does not force the data to conform to any particular structure (including grid-like); reduces reliance on error-prone optimisation of inducing point locations; and is able to learn rich (covariance) structure from the data. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on real data in regression, time-series prediction and signal-interpolation experiments.","cited_in":[],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232805135_Deep_Gaussian_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220431865_Efficient_Descriptor-Vector_Multiplications_in_Stochastic_Automata_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260089482_Distributed_Variational_Inference_in_Sparse_Gaussian_Process_Regression_and_Latent_Variable_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257069490_Gaussian_Processes_for_Big_Data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320714_Probabilistic_Non-linear_Principal_Component_Analysis_with_Gaussian_Process_Latent_Variable_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264742891_Fastfood_Approximate_Kernel_Expansions_in_Loglinear_Time","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220493046_Remark_on_Algorithm_778_L-BFGS-B_fortran_subroutines_for_large-scale_bound_constrained_optimization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320671_A_Unifying_View_of_Sparse_Approximate_Gaussian_Process_Regression","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269996418_Gaussian_Processes_for_Machine_Learning_Adaptive_Computation_and_Machine_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258083384_Efficient_State-Space_Inference_of_Periodic_Latent_Force_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255991781_Scalable_Inference_for_Structured_Gaussian_Process_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259844876_Hilbert_Space_Methods_for_Reduced-Rank_Gaussian_Process_Regression","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224584618_Wind_Power_Density_Forecasting_Using_Ensemble_Predictions_and_Time_Series_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320048_Variational_Learning_of_Inducing_Variables_in_Sparse_Gaussian_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221617879_Discovering_Hidden_Features_with_Gaussian_Processes_Regression","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258082652_GPatt_Fast_Multidimensional_Pattern_Extrapolation_with_Gaussian_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233981807_ADADELTA_An_adaptive_learning_rate_method"]}
