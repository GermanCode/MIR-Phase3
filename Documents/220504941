{"id":220504941,"title":"On-Line Learning for the Infinite Hidden Markov Model","authors":["Abel Rodriguez"],"_abstract":"We develop a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm for the infinite hidden Markov model (iHMM) that allows us to perform on-line inferences on both system states and structural (static) parameters. The algorithm described here provides a natural alternative to Markov chain Monte Carlo samplers previously developed for the iHMM, and is particularly helpful in applications where data is collected sequentially and model parameters need to be continuously updated. We illustrate our approach in the context of both a simulation study and a financial application.","cited_in":[{"id":220320763,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320763_Online_Variational_Inference_for_the_Hierarchical_Dirichlet_Process"},{"id":261536103,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261536103_Modeling_the_dynamics_of_social_networks_using_Bayesian_hierarchical_blockmodels"}],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238684341_Estimating_Normal_Means_with_a_Dirichlet_Process_Prior","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2741222_Bayesian_Density_Estimation_and_Inference_Using_Mixtures","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38357634_A_Bayesian_Analysis_of_Some_Non-Parametric_Problems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236114920_Latent_Stick-Breaking_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221345210_Beam_sampling_for_the_infinite_hidden_Markov_model","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224839919_A_New_Approach_To_Linear_Filtering_and_Prediction_Problems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4742259_Hierarchical_Dirichlet_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4986787_Bayesian_Analysis_of_Stochastic_Volatility_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4746760_Monte_Carlo_Smoothing_for_Nonlinear_Time_Series","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227369072_The_Nested_Dirichlet_Process","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38359078_On_a_Class_of_Bayesian_Nonparametric_Estimates_I_Density_Estimates","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243133455_Sequential_Monte_Carlo_Methods_in_Practice","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221344933_An_HDP-HMM_for_systems_with_state_persistence","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2998263_An_Overview_of_Existing_Methods_and_Recent_Advances_in_Sequential_Monte_Carlo","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229100417_A_Constructive_Definition_of_the_Dirichlet_Prior","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236853542_Inference_in_Hidden_Markov_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46451640_Sampling_the_Dirichlet_Mixture_Model_with_Slices","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229100346_Markov_Chain_Sampling_Methods_for_Dirichlet_Process_Mixture_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221619411_Sharing_Clusters_among_Related_Groups_Hierarchical_Dirichlet_Processes"]}
