{"id":257300274,"title":"How Robust Are Probabilistic Models of Higher-Level Cognition?","authors":["Gary F Marcus","Ernest Davis"],"_abstract":"An increasingly popular theory holds that the mind should be viewed as a near-optimal or rational engine of probabilistic inference, in domains as diverse as word learning, pragmatics, naive physics, and predictions of the future. We argue that this view, often identified with Bayesian models of inference, is markedly less promising than widely believed, and is undermined by post hoc practices that merit wholesale reevaluation. We also show that the common equation between probabilistic and rational or optimal is not justified.","cited_in":[{"id":282874072,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282874072_Using_Alien_Coins_to_Test_Whether_Simple_Inference_Is_Bayesian"},{"id":276204445,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276204445_Humans_predict_liquid_dynamics_using_probabilistic_simulation"},{"id":268989000,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268989000_Spatial_estimation_A_non-Bayesian_alternative"},{"id":264462250,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264462250_Surprisingly_Rational_Probability_Theory_Plus_Noise_Explains_Biases_in_Judgment"},{"id":228425907,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228425907_The_Influence_of_Prior_Knowledge_on_Recall_for_Height"},{"id":261748694,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261748694_The_Balance_Beam_Metaphor_A_Perspective_on_Clinical_Diagnosis"},{"id":262018398,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262018398_Optimal_response_selection_and_decisional_separability_in_Gaussian_general_recognition_theory"},{"id":263740097,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263740097_Probabilistic_models_learning_algorithms_and_response_variability_Sampling_in_cognitive_development"},{"id":264430546,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264430546_Win-Stay_Lose-Sample_A_simple_sequential_algorithm_for_approximating_Bayesian_inference"},{"id":265862128,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265862128_Moving_beyond_qualitative_evaluations_of_Bayesian_models_of_cognition"},{"id":267696297,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267696297_Naive_Probability_Model-Based_Estimates_of_Unique_Events"},{"id":267340658,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267340658_From_intrapsychic_to_ecological_theories_in_social_psychology_Outlines_of_a_functional_theory_approach_From_intrapsychic_to_ecological_theories"},{"id":269414876,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269414876_Developmental_insights_into_mature_cognition"},{"id":273148787,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273148787_The_cost_of_misremembering_Inferring_the_loss_function_in_visual_working_memory"},{"id":267638402,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267638402_Beyond_Single-Level_Accounts_The_Role_of_Cognitive_Architectures_in_Cognitive_Scientific_Explanation"},{"id":273330363,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273330363_Thirty_Years_After_Marr's_Vision_Levels_of_Analysis_in_Cognitive_Science"},{"id":273324309,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273324309_Still_Searching_for_Principles_A_Response_to_Goodman_et_al_2015"},{"id":273324308,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273324308_Relevant_and_Robust_A_Response_to_Marcus_and_Davis_2013"},{"id":273577948,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273577948_Logic_probability_and_human_reasoning"},{"id":286448063,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286448063_Regel-basierte_Kategorisierung_mit_dem_Hierarchischen_Dirichlet_Prozess"},{"id":277410990,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277410990_Probabilistic_machine_learning_and_artificial_intelligence"},{"id":274264019,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274264019_Evaluating_the_inverse_reasoning_account_of_object_discovery"}],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200045075_Reflections_of_the_Environment_in_Memory","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220636807_Confirmation_in_the_Cognitive_Sciences_The_Problematic_Case_of_Bayesian_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7027485_Children's_use_of_frequency_information_for_trait_categorization_and_behavioral_prediction","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51592838_Bayesian_Fundamentalism_or_Enlightenment_On_the_Explanatory_Status_and_Theoretical_Contributions_of_Bayesian_Models_of_Cognition","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225130187_Is_probability_matching_smart_Associations_between_probabilistic_choices_and_cognitive_ability","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222746354_Proactive_inhibition_and_item_similarity_in_short-term_memory","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5473566_Intuitive_statistics_by_8-month-olds","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/16001920_Naive_beliefs_in_sophisticated_subjects_Misconceptions_about_trajectories_of_objects","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6810689_Optimal_Predictions_in_Everyday_Cognition","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227545747_Bayesian_learning_theory_applied_to_human_cognition","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4729526_Maps_of_Bounded_Rationality_Psychology_for_Behavioral_Economics_Article","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6330774_Word_Learning_as_Bayesian_Inference","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/22295075_Evolution_and_Tinkering","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226969520_Inverse_statistics_and_misperception_of_exponential_growth","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232597201_Extension_Versus_Intuitive_Reasoning
