{"id":284787775,"title":"An open access repository of images on plant health to enable the development of mobile disease diagnostics through machine learning and crowdsourcing","authors":["David. P. Hughes","Marcel Salathe"],"_abstract":"Human society needs to increase food production by an estimated 70% by 2050 to feed an expected population size that is predicted to be over 9 billion people. Currently infectious diseases reduce the potential yield by an average of 40% with many farmers in the developing world experiencing yield losses as high as 100%. Infectious diseases of crops are not new and historic examples such as the Irish Potato Famine of 1845-49 demonstrate this. But what is new is the widespread distribution of smartphones among crop growers around the world with an expected 5 billion smartphones by 2020. This offers the potential of turning the smartphone into a valuable tool for diverse communities growing food. One potential application is the development of mobile disease diagnostics through machine learning and crowdsourcing. Computer vision and machine learning have shown their potential to automatically classify images. To do this for plant diseases requires a training set that facilitates the development of the algorithms. Here we announce the release of >50,000 expertly curated images on healthy and infected leaves of crops plants through the existing platform www.PlantVillage.org. We describe both the data and the platform. These data are the beginning of an on-going, crowdsourcing effort to enable computer vision approaches to help solve the problem of yield losses in crop plants due to infectious diseases.","cited_in":[],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269538873_Introduction_to_the_History_of_Mycology","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232894800_A_chicken_ain't_nothin'_but_a_bird_local_food_production_and_the_politics_of_land-use_change","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261530360_The_green_revolution_revisited_and_the_road_ahead_Special_30th_anniversary_lecture_Norwegian_Nobel_Institute_Oslo","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228405399_Farmer_Field_Schools_and_Local_Agricultural_Research_Committees_Complementary_Platforms_for_Integrated_Decision-Making_in_Sustainable_Agriculture","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11218799_Diamond_J_Evolution_consequences_and_future_of_plant_and_animal_domestication_Nature_418_700-707","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254447483_Institutions_and_the_African_Farmer","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225646524_The_importance_of_plant_health_to_food_security","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277410990_Probabilistic_machine_learning_and_artificial_intelligence","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237151242_The_history_development_and_future_of_agricultural_extension","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46525612_Running_Experiments_Using_Amazon_Mechanical_Turk","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271829999_Incongruity_between_Affinity_Patterns_Based_on_Mandibular_and_Lower_Dental_Dimensions_following_the_Transition_to_Agriculture_in_the_Near_East_Anatolia_and_Europe","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259641801_The_Omnivore's_Dilemma_A_Natural_History_of_Four_Meals","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265295439_ImageNet_Large_Scale_Visual_Recognition_Challenge","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270005492_Gracility_of_the_modern_Homo_sapiens_skeleton_is_the_result_of_decreased_biomechanical_loading","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273163713_En_route_to_plentiful_food_production_in_Africa","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263564119_DeepFace_Closing_the_Gap_to_Human-Level_Performance_in_Face_Verification","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262193686_Large-Scale_Psychological_Differences_Within_China_Explained_by_Rice_Versus_Wheat_Agriculture","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223993540_Machine_learning_and_radiology_Med_Image_Anal"]}
