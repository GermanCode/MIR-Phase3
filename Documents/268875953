{"id":268875953,"title":"A Bayesian hierarchical spatial point process model for multi-type neuroimaging meta-analysis","authors":["Jian Kang","Thomas Nichols","Tor D Wager","Timothy D Johnson"],"_abstract":"Neuroimaging meta-analysis is an important tool for finding consistent effects over studies that each usually have 20 or fewer subjects. Interest in meta-analysis in brain mapping is also driven by a recent focus on so-called \"reverse inference\": where as traditional \"forward inference\" identifies the regions of the brain involved in a task, a reverse inference identifies the cognitive processes that a task engages. Such reverse inferences, however, requires a set of meta-analysis, one for each possible cognitive domain. However, existing methods for neuroimaging meta-analysis have significant limitations. Commonly used methods for neuroimaging meta-analysis are not model based, do not provide interpretable parameter estimates, and only produce null hypothesis inferences; further, they are generally designed for a single group of studies and cannot produce reverse inferences. In this work we address these limitations by adopting a non-parametric Bayesian approach for meta analysis data from multiple classes or types of studies. In particular, foci from each type of study are modeled as a cluster process driven by a random intensity function that is modeled as a kernel convolution of a gamma random field. The type-specific gamma random fields are linked and modeled as a realization of a common gamma random field, shared by all types, that induces correlation between study types and mimics the behavior of a univariate mixed effects model. We illustrate our model on simulation studies and a meta analysis of five emotions from 219 studies and check model fit by a posterior predictive assessment. In addition, we implement reverse inference by using the model to predict study type from a newly presented study. We evaluate this predictive performance via leave-one-out cross validation that is efficiently implemented using importance sampling techniques.","cited_in":[{"id":267812406,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267812406_Bayesian_models_for_functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging_data_analysis"},{"id":287419720,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287419720_Involvement_of_Sensory_Regions_in_Affective_Experience_A_Meta-Analysis"}],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/47155948_Cognitive_neuroscience_20_Building_a_cumulative_science_of_human_brain_function","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51250642_Meta_Analysis_of_Functional_Neuroimaging_Data_via_Bayesian_Spatial_Point_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11218210_Meta-Anlysis_of_the_Functional_Neuroanatomy_of_Single-Word_Reading_Method_and_Validation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11524493_Modeling_of_activation_data_in_the_BrainMap_TM_database_Detection_of_outliers","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/10644442_Valence_Gender_and_Lateralization_of_Functional_Brain_Anatomy_in_Emotion_A_Meta-Analysis_of_Findings_from_Neuroimaging","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8433702_Neuroimaging_studies_of_shifting_attention_A_meta-analysis_NeuroImage_224_1679-1693","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5771576_Costafreda_SG_Brammer_MJ_David_AS_Fu_CH_Predictors_of_amygdala_activation_during_the_processing_of_emotional_stimuli_a_meta-analysis_of_385_PET_and_fMRI_studies_Brain_Res_Rev_58_57-70","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/43228105_Functional_volumes_modeling_Theory_and_preliminary_assessment","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46451640_Sampling_the_Dirichlet_Mixture_Model_with_Slices","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247752399_The_Human_Amygdala_and_Emotion","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2527134_Extrapolating_and_Interpolating_Spatial_Patterns","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51863580_Inferring_Mental_States_from_Neuroimaging_Data_From_Reverse_Inference_to_Large-Scale_Decoding","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225792510_Spatial_Inference_of_Nitrate_Concentrations_in","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23951773_Coordinate-based_ALE_meta-analysis_of_neuroimaging_data_a_random-effects_approach_based_on_empirical_estimates_of_spatial_uncertainty","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266165383_Spatial_regression_for_marked_point_processes_With_discussion","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38357634_A_Bayesian_Analysis_of_Some_Non-Parametric_Problems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225252882_Spatial_point_process_analysis_for_a_plant_community_with_high_biodiversity","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227701452_Log_Gaussian_Cox_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247020626_On_Simulation_from_Infinitely_Divisible_Distributions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227635450_Modern_Statistics_for_Spatial_Point_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/32896369_Hierarchical_Dirichlet_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226962081_Bayesian_Spatial_Point_Process_Modeling_of_Line_Transect_Data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265672350_PoissonGamma_Random_Field_Models_for_Spatial_Statistics","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12946116_Core_affect_prototypical_emotional_episodes_and_other_things_called_emotion_dissecting_the_elephant_J_Pers_Soc_Psychol","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228083468_Meta-analysis_of_functional_neuroimaging_data_using_Bayesiannonparametric_binary_regression","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260161521_Approximate_Random_Variate_Generation_from_Infinitely_Divisible_Distributions_with_Applications_to_Bayesian_Inference","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225056361_The_Brain_Basis_of_Emotion_A_Meta-Analytic_Review","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232128445_Some_Statistical_Methods_Connected_With_Series_of_Events_With_Discussion","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7295152_Paton_JJ_Belova_MA_Morrison_SE_Salzman_CD_The_primate_amygdala_represents_the_positive_and_negative_value_of_visual_stimuli_during_learning_Nature_439_865-870","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38059152_Radua_J_Mataix-Cols_D_Voxel-wise_meta-analysis_of_grey_matter_changes_in_obsessive-compulsive_disorder_Br_J_Psychiatry_195_393-402","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38363224_Inference_From_Iterative_Simulation_Using_Multiple_Sequences","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5275658_Functional_Grouping_and_Cortical-Subcortical_Interactions_in_Emotion_A_Meta-Analysis_of_Neuroimaging_Studies","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281093787_Spatial_Poisson_Regression_for_Health_and_Exposure_Data_Measured_at_Disparate_Resolutions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2469005_Simulation_of_Levy_Random_Fields"]}
