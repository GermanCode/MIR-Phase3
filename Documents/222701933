{"id":222701933,"title":"Stability of user-equilibrium route flow solutions for the traffic assignment problem","authors":["Shu Lu","Yu (Marco) Nie"],"_abstract":"This paper studies stability of user-equilibrium (UE) route flow solutions with respect to inputs to a traffic assignment problem, namely the travel demand and parameters in the link cost function. It shows, under certain continuity and strict monotonicity assumptions on the link cost function, that the UE link flow is a continuous function of the inputs, that the set of UE route flows is a continuous multifunction of the inputs, and that the UE route flow selected to maximize an objective function with certain properties is a continuous function of the inputs. The maximum entropy UE route flow is an example of the last. On the other hand, a UE route flow arbitrarily generated in a standard traffic assignment procedure may not bear such continuity property, as demonstrated by an example in this paper.","cited_in":[{"id":264983133,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264983133_Range_of_User-equilibrium_Route_Flow_with_Applications"},{"id":259535754,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259535754_A_new_kind_of_fundamental_diagram_with_an_application_to_road_traffic_emission_modeling"},{"id":272718492,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272718492_Select_Zone_Analysis_for_Traffic_Impact_Studies"},{"id":258383412,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258383412_Analysis_of_ITMS_System_Impact_Mechanism_in_Beijing_Based_on_FD_and_Traffic_Entropy"},{"id":275985328,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275985328_Predicting_Road_Traffic_Route_Flows_Uniquely_for_Urban_Transportation_Planning"},{"id":257044533,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257044533_Bush-based_sensitivity_analysis_for_approximating_subnetwork_diversion"},{"id":241084122,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241084122_User-equilibrium_route_flows_and_the_condition_of_proportionality"},{"id":257591221,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257591221_Well-posedness_of_a_parametric_traffic_network_problem"},{"id":264360401,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264360401_The_Use_of_Smartphone_Applications_in_the_Collection_of_Travel_Behaviour_Data"},{"id":262223903,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262223903_On_uniqueness_and_proportionality_in_multi-class_equilibrium_assignment_v24"},{"id":237269709,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237269709_Repetitions_in_individual_daily_activity-travel-location_patterns_A_study_using_the_Herfindahl-Hirschman_Index"},{"id":268222695,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268222695_On_uniqueness_and_proportionality_in_multi-class_equilibrium_assignment"},{"id":267755263,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267755263_Chapter_2_Typical_Base_Optimization_Problems"},{"id":275946239,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275946239_Optimization_of_Logistics_Theory_Practice"},{"id":284841776,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284841776_An_analysis_of_activity_time_use_on_vehicle_usage_rationed_days"},{"id":277891265,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277891265_Entropy_Weighted_Average_Method_for_the_Determination_of_a_Single_Representative_Path_Flow_Solution_for_the_Static_User_Equilibrium_Traffic_Assignment_Problem"},{"id":276927977,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276927977_Day-to-day_variability_in_travellers'_activity-travel_patterns_in_the_Jakarta_metropolitan_area"},{"id":279514276,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279514276_Kumar-Peeta-Entropy-TR-Part-B-2015"},{"id":279312311,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279312311_Traffic_user_equilibrium_and_proportionality"},{"id":290196311,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/290196311_Improved_bush-based_methods_for_network_contraction"},{"id":286732378,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286732378_Mechanisms_that_Govern_how_the_Price_of_Anarchy_varies_with_Travel_Demand"}],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225760457_Sensitivity_Analysis_for_the_Asymmetric_Network_Equilibrium_Problem","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224680516_On_the_Goldstein-Levitin-Polyak_gradient_projection_method","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220413286_Sensitivity_of_Static_Traffic_User_Equilibria_with_Perturbations_in_Arc_Cost_Function_and_Travel_Demand","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23527585_A_reduction_method_for_local_sensitivity_analyses_of_network_equilibrium_arc_flows","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220413008_Primal_Method_for_Determining_the_Most_Likely_Route_Flows_in_Large_Road_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242933045_Traffic_Equilibria_and_Variational_Inequalities","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/37596062_Sensitivity_Analysis_for_Variational_Inequalities_Defined_on_Polyhedral_Sets","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23526868_Existence_uniqueness_and_stability_of_traffic_equilibria_Transp_Res_B","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243778262_The_Trac_Assignment_Problem_Models_and_Methods","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243779526_Network_Economics_A_Variational_Inequality_Approach","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227427028_Traffic_assignment_by_paired_alternative_segments","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220412956_Sensitivity_Analysis_of_Aggregated_Variational_Inequality_Problems_with_Application_to_Traffic_Equilibria","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3027596_On_the_Goldstein-Levitin-Polyak_gradient_projection_method","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223021870_Equilibrium_analysis_of_macroscopic_traffic_oscillations","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245291790_Entropy_Model_for_Consistent_Impact-Fee_Assessment","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239060799_Properties_of_the_Equ
