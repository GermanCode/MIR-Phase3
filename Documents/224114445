{"id":224114445,"title":"Nonparametric learning of dictionaries for sparse representation of sensor signals","authors":["Mingyuan Zhou","John Paisley","Lawrence Carin"],"_abstract":"Nonparametric Bayesian techniques are considered for learning dictionaries for sparse data representations, with applications in sparse rendering of sensor data. The beta process is employed as a prior for learning the dictionary, and this nonparametric method naturally infers an appropriate dictionary size. The proposed method can learn a sparse dictionary, and may also be used to denoise a signal under test. The noise variance need not be known, and can be non-stationary. The dictionary coefficients for a given sensor signal may be employed within a classifier. Several example results are presented, using both Gibbs and variational Bayesian inference, with comparisons to other state-of-the-art approaches.","cited_in":[{"id":254009006,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254009006_The_'neural_space'_A_physiologically_inspired_noise_reduction_strategy_based_on_fractional_derivatives"},{"id":254054096,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254054096_Supervised_sparse_coding_strategy_in_hearing_aids"},{"id":290390475,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/290390475_Image_noise_reduction_with_subband_replacement_and_fusion_process_using_Bayes_estimators"}],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26268043_Learning_to_Sense_Sparse_Signals_Simultaneous_Sensing_Matrix_and_Sparsifying_Dictionary_Optimization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6645277_Image_Denoising_Via_Sparse_and_Redundant_Representations_Over_Learned_Dictionaries","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220848162_Infinite_Sparse_Factor_Analysis_and_Infinite_Independent_Components_Analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221344789_Online_dictionary_learning_for_sparse_coding_In_ICML_'09","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220321011_Hierarchical_Beta_Processes_and_the_Indian_Buffet_Process","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221997039_Regression_shrinkage_and_selection_via_the_LASSO_J_R_Stat_Soc_B","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/216792739_Efficient_Learning_of_Sparse_Representations_with_an_Energy-Based_Model","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/1775282_Supervised_Dictionary_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224309574_Robust_Face_Recognition_via_Sparse_Representation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2413122_Sparse_Bayesian_Learning_and_the_Relevance_Vector_Machine","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228849368_Non-parametric_Bayesian_Hierarchical_Factor_Modeling_and_Regression","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/34000771_Variational_algorithms_for_approximate_Bayesian_inference","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221346465_Nonparametric_factor_analysis_with_Beta_process_priors","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3319912_K-SVD_An_Algorithm_for_Designing_Overcomplete_Dictionaries_for_Sparse_Representation_IEEE_Trans_Signal_Processing_54_4311-4322","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224881814_Tipping_ME_Sparse_bayesian_learning_and_the_relevance_vector_machine_JMLR_1","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13803865_Olshausen_BA_Field_DJ_Sparse_coding_with_an_overcomplete_basis_set_a_strategy_employed_by_V1_Vision_Res_37_3311-3325","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5621705_Sparse_representation_for_color_image_restoration_IEEE_Trans_Image_Process_17153","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221995776_An_Introduction_to_Support_Vector_Machines","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200038912_Self-taught_learning_Transfer_learning_from_unlabeled_data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220322243_Bayesian_Compressive_Sensing","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283360188_Sparse_Coding_with_an_Overcomplete_Basis_Set_A_Strategy_Employed_by_V1","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224514581_Sparse_Bayesian_Learning_and_Relevance_Vector_Machine"]}
