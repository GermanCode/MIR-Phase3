Bengio","Yann Lecun"],"_abstract":"A system for discriminative feature and model design is presented for automatic speech recognition. Training based on minimum classification error with a single objective function is applied for designing a set of parallel networks performing feature transformation and a set of hidden Markov models performing speech recognition. This paper compares the use of linear and non-linear functional transformations when applied to conventional recognition features, such as spectrum or cepstrum. It also provides a framework for integrated feature and model training when using class-specific transformations. Experimental results on telephone-based connected digit recognition are presented. 1. INTRODUCTION Improving the performance of hidden Markov model (HMM) based automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems has been a central issue that has dominated the entire field of speech recognition during the past two decades. One effort to improving HMMs has been by extending the training paradigm beyo...","cited_in":[{"id":224750582,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224750582_Optimizing_acoustic_models_for_commercial_speech_recognition_using_foreground_scores_and_data_weighting"},{"id":221490650,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221490650_Neural_network_motivation_for_segmental_distribution"},{"id":2305846,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2305846_Nonlinear_Discriminant_Feature_Extraction_For_Robust_Text-Independent_Speaker_Recognition"},{"id":2985446,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2985446_Gradient-based_learning_applied_to_document_recognition_Proc_IEEE"},{"id":220656216,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220656216_Robust_Speaker_Recognition_in_Noisy_Conditions"}],"reference":[]}
