{"id":283532090,"title":"The Variational Fair Auto Encoder","authors":["Christos Louizos","Kevin Swersky","Yujia Li","Max Welling","Richard Zemel"],"_abstract":"ABSTRACT We investigate the problem of learning representations that are invariant to certain nuisance or sensitive factors of variation in the data while retaining as much of the remaining information as possible. Our model is based on a variational auto-encoding architecture with priors that encourage independence between sensitive and latent factors of variation. Any subsequent processing, such as classification, can then be performed on this purged latent representation. To remove any remaining dependencies we incorporate an additional penalty term based on the ``Maximum Mean Discrepancy'' (MMD) measure. We discuss how these architectures can be efficiently trained on data and show in experiments that this method is more effective than previous work in removing unwanted sources of variation while maintaining informative latent representations.","cited_in":[{"id":284219429,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284219429_Censoring_Representations_with_an_Adversary"},{"id":284097267,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284097267_A_Test_of_Relative_Similarity"}],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220343859_A_theory_of_learning_from_different_domains","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277333816_Domain-Adversarial_Training_of_Neural_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41781721_A_Kernel_Method_for_the_Two-Sample-Problem","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272194743_Batch_Normalization_Accelerating_Deep_Network_Training_by_Reducing_Internal_Covariate_Shift","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2899274_Detecting_Change_in_Data_Streams","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269935079_Adam_A_Method_for_Stochastic_Optimization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259400035_Auto-Encoding_Variational_Bayes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263316327_Semi-Supervised_Learning_with_Deep_Generative_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269721958_Learning_unbiased_features","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272194892_Learning_Transferable_Features_with_Deep_Adaptation_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221620057_Weighted_Sums_of_Random_Kitchen_Sinks_Replacing_minimization_with_randomization_in_learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262991675_Stochastic_Backpropagation_and_Approximate_Inference_in_Deep_Generative_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269416972_Deep_Domain_Confusion_Maximizing_for_Domain_Invariance","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262264041_FastMMD_Ensemble_of_Circular_Discrepancy_for_Efficient_Two-Sample_Test"]}
