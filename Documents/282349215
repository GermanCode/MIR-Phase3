{"id":282349215,"title":"Kriging of financial term structures","authors":["Areski Cousin","Hassan Maatouk","Didier Rulli√®re"],"_abstract":"Due to the lack of reliable market information, building financial term-structures may be associated with a significant degree of uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a new term-structure interpolation method that extends classical spline technics by additionally allowing for quantification of uncertainty. The proposed method is based on a generalization of kriging models with linear equality constraints (market-fit conditions) and shape-preserving conditions such as monotonicity or positivity (no-arbitrage conditions). We define the most likely curve and show how to build confidence bands. The Gaussian process covariance hyper-parameters under the construction constraints are estimated using cross-validation technics. Based on observed market quotes at different dates, we demonstrate the efficiency of the method by building curves together with confidence intervals for term-structures of OIS discount rates, of zero-coupon swaps rates and of CDS implied default probabilities. We also show how to construct interest-rate surfaces or default probability surfaces by considering time (quotation dates) as an additional dimension.","cited_in":[],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228267619_Bootstrapping_the_Illiquidity_Multiple_Yield_Curves_Construction_for_Market_Coherent_Forward_Rates_Estimation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5156702_Discount_curve_construction_with_tension_splines","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228315693_A_Spatial_Analysis_of_International_Stock_Market_Linkages","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234168780_Cross_Validation_and_Maximum_Likelihood_estimation_of_hyper-parameters_of_Gaussian_processes_with_model_misspecification","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221528565_Response_surface_methodology_for_simulating_hedging_and_trading_strategies","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228183630_Model_Risk_A_Conceptual_Framework_for_Risk_Measurement_and_Hedging","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256001250_Building_Curves_on_a_Good_Basis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2905234_Model_Uncertainty_and_Its_Impact_on_the_Pricing_of_Derivative_Instruments","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227216707_The_Origins_of_Kriging","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230663724_Statistics_for_Spatial_Data_Revised_Edition_Wiley_New_York","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4777039_The_Range_of_Traded_Option_Prices","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222649681_A_geostatistical_approach_for_dynamic_life_tables_The_effect_of_mortality_on_remaining_lifetime_and_annuities","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24055490_On_the_Range_of_Option_Prices","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227637040_Robustness_of_the_Black-Scholes_Formula","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256043647_Curves_and_Term_Structure_Models_Definition_Calibration_and_Application_of_Rate_Curves_and_Term_Structure_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272218092_Valuation_of_Large_Variable_Annuity_Portfolios_Under_Nested_Simulations_A_Functional_Data_Approach","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4992511_Market_Risk_and_Model_Risk_for_a_Financial_Institution_Writing_Options","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259118568_Application_of_data_clustering_and_machine_learning_in_variable_annuity_valuation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24071726_Interpolation_Methods_for_Curve_Construction","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228303670_A_Normalized_Measure_of_Model_Risk","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256045868_LIBOR_vs_OIS_The_derivatives_discounting_dilemma","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235709802_Efficient_Global_Optimization_of_Expensive_Black-Box_Functions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257211572_ISSN_0924-7815Backtesting_for_Risk-Based_Regulatory_Capital","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46433807_Monotonicity-Preserving_Bootstrapped_Kriging_Metamodels_for_Expensive_Simulations","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263808213_Stochastic_kriging_for_efficient_nested_simulation_of_ecpexted_shortfall","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278828680_A_New_Rejection_Sampling_Method_for_Truncated_Multivariate_Gaussian_Random_Variables_Restricted_to_Convex_Sets","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281408400_Gaussian_Process_Emulators_for_Computer_Experiments_with_Inequality_Constraints","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281128751_Cross-Validation_Estimations_of_Hyper-Parameters_of_Gaussian_Processes_with_Inequality_Constraints","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/246623546_Kriging_and_Splines_with_Derivative_Information_Biometrika_83_pp207-221","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281766832_Understanding_and_Managing_Model_Risk_A_Practical_Guide_for_Quants_Traders_and_Validators","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24103017_Parsimonious_Modeling_of_Yield_Curves","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46461678_Interest-Rate_Modeling_with_Multiple_Yield_Curves","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23506531_A_Spatial_Approach_to_Addressing_Weather_Derivative_Basis_Risk_A_Drought_Insurance_Example","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269996418_Gaussian_Processes_for_Machine_Learning_Adaptive_Computation_and_Machine_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45863756_Simulation_of_truncated_normal_variates","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/44842093_DiceKriging_DiceOptim_Two_R_Packages_for_the_Analysis_of_Computer_Experiments_by_Kriging-Based_Metamodeling_and_Optimization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/216301381_The_Design_and_Analysis_Computer_Experiments","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220505020_Machine_Learning_Vasicek_Model_Calibration_with_Gaussian_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265205269_Fitting_Financial_Models_to_Market_Data_Using_Kriging"]}
