{"id":288713862,"title":"Part-Stacked CNN for Fine-Grained Visual Categorization","authors":["Shaoli Huang","Zhe Xu","Dacheng Tao","Ya Zhang"],"_abstract":"ABSTRACT In the context of fine-grained visual categorization, the ability to interpret models as human-understandable visual manuals is sometimes as important as achieving high classification accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel Part-Stacked CNN architecture that explicitly explains the fine-grained recognition process by modeling subtle differences from object parts. Based on manually-labeled strong part annotations, the proposed architecture consists of a fully convolutional network to locate multiple object parts and a two-stream classification network that en- codes object-level and part-level cues simultaneously. By adopting a set of sharing strategies between the computation of multiple object parts, the proposed architecture is very efficient running at 20 frames/sec during inference. Experimental results on the CUB-200-2011 dataset reveal the effectiveness of the proposed architecture, from both the perspective of classification accuracy and model interpretability.","cited_in":[],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261038501_Image_segmentation_for_large-scale_subcategory_flower_recognition","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261854164_How_Do_You_Tell_a_Blackbird_from_a_Crow","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221618991_Kernel_Descriptors_for_Visual_Recognition","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221304729_Visual_Recognition_with_Humans_in_the_Loop","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269339162_Actions_and_Attributes_from_Wholes_and_Parts","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268391589_Fully_Convolutional_Networks_for_Semantic_Segmentation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262437321_Part_and_Attribute_Discovery_from_Relative_Annotations","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2249500_Multi-Digit_Recognition_Using_A_Space_Displacement_Neural_Network","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261100864_CNN_Features_Off-the-Shelf_An_Astounding_Baseline_for_Recognition","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242366361_Basic_Objects_in_Natural_Categories","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259441043_OverFeat_Integrated_Recognition_Localization_and_Detection_using_Convolutional_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265787949_Going_Deeper_with_Convolutions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263048918_Joint_Training_of_a_Convolutional_Network_and_a_Graphical_Model_for_Human_Pose_Estimation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280894698_Understanding_Objects_in_Detail_with_Fine-Grained_Attributes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221111053_Multiclass_recognition_and_part_localization_with_humans_in_the_loop","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268747867_The_Application_of_Two-level_Attention_Models_in_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Network_for_Fine-grained_Image_Classification","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263967862_Part-based_R-CNNs_for_Fine-grained_Category_Detection","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258839715_PANDA_Pose_Aligned_Networks_for_Deep_Attribute_Modeling","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45200127_Object_Detection_with_Discriminatively_Trained_Part-Based_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264979485_Caffe_Convolutional_Architecture_for_Fast_Feature_Embedding","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46572499_Caltech-UCSD_Birds_200","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265385906_Very_Deep_Convolutional_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Recognition","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263048868_Bird_Species_Categorization_Using_Pose_Normalized_Deep_Convolutional_Nets","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261227383_Fine-Grained_Crowdsourcing_for_Fine-Grained_Recognition","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286813583_Similarity_Comparisons_for_Interactive_Fine-Grained_Categorization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261259204_POOF_Part-Based_One-vs-One_Features_for_Fine-Grained_Categorization_Face_Verification_and_Attribute_Estimation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262243757_Symbiotic_Segmentation_and_Part_Localization_for_Fine-Grained_Categorization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286594192_Birdsnap_Large-Scale_Fine-Grained_Visual_Categorization_of_Birds","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259624679_Leafsnap_A_Computer_Vision_System_for_Automatic_Plant_Species_Identification","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271918863_The_Ignorant_Led_by_the_Blind_A_Hybrid_Human-Machine_Vision_System_for_Fine-Grained_Categorization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258510738_Fine-Grained_Categorization_by_Alignments","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271659916_Local_Alignments_for_Fine-Grained_Categorization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267869965_Do_Convnets_Learn_Correspondence","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221551861_Automated_flower_classification_over_a_large_number_of_classes_ICCVGIP08","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257409887_DeCAF_A_Deep_Convolutional_Activation_Feature_for_Generic_Visual_Recognition","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280851876_Fisher_Vectors_for_Fine-Grained_Visual_Categorization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260106933_Fine-Grained_Categorization_for_3D_Scene_Understanding","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275669662_Bilinear_CNN_Models_for_Fine-grained_Visual_Recognition"]}
