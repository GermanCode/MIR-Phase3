{"id":236627542,"title":"On the Amount of Dependence in the Prime Factorization of a Uniform Random Integer","authors":["Richard Arratia"],"_abstract":"ABSTRACT How much dependence is there in the prime factorization of a random integer distributed uniformly from 1 to n? How much dependence is there in the decomposition into cycles of a random permutation of n points? What is the relation between the Poisson-Dirichlet process and the scale invariant Poisson process? These three questions have essentially the same answers, with respect to total variation distance, considering only small components, and with respect to a Wasserstein distance, considering all components. The Wasserstein distance is the expected number of changes -- insertions and deletions -- needed to change the dependent system into an independent system. In particular we show that for primes, roughly speaking, 2+o(1) changes are necessary and sufficient to convert a uniformly distributed random integer from 1 to n into a random integer prod_{p leq n} p^{Z_p} in which the multiplicity Z_p of the factor p is geometrically distributed, with all Z_p independent. The changes are, with probability tending to 1, one deletion, together with a random number of insertions, having expectation 1+o(1). The crucial tool for showing that 2+epsilon suffices is a coupling of the infinite independent model of prime multiplicities, with the scale invariant Poisson process on (0,infty). A corollary of this construction is the first metric bound on the distance to the Poisson-Dirichlet in Billingsley's 1972 weak convergence result. Our bound takes the form: there are couplings in which E sum |log P_i(n) - (log n) V_i | = O(\\log \\log n), where P_i denotes the i-th largest prime factor and V_i denotes the i-th component of the Poisson-Dirichlet process. It is reasonable to conjecture that O(1) is achievable.","cited_in":[{"id":259604459,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259604459_A_Simple_Direct_Proof_of_Billingsley's_Theorem"},{"id":255787245,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255787245_Size_bias_for_one_and_all"},{"id":220357797,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220357797_A_Tale_of_Three_Couplings_Poisson-Dirichlet_and_GEM_Approximations_for_Random_Permutations"},{"id":51946246,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51946246_Probabilistic_Divide-and-Conquer_A_New_Exact_Simulation_Method_With_Integer_Partitions_as_an_Example"}],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/31071912_A_Rate_Estimate_in_Billingsleys_Theorem_for_the_Size_Distribution_of_Large_Prime_Factors","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268735906_Number-theoretic_basis_of_the_probabilistic_theory_of_numbers","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243770923_On_the_frequency_of_numbers_containing_prime_factors_of_a_certain_relative_magnitude","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238869688_The_Intermediate_Prime_Divisors_of_Integers","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2826951_The_Two_Parameter_Poisson-Dirichlet_Distribution_Derived_From_a_Stable_Subordinator","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/22288231_The_population_structure_associated_with_the_Ewens_sampling_formula_Theoret_Population_Biol_11_274-284","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220345482_Order_Statistics_for_Decomposable_Combinatorial_Structures","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243766298_Exchangeability_and_Related_Topics","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240189892_Prime_Numbers_and_Brownian_Motion","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38363377_Poisson_Approximation_and_the_Chen-Stein_Method_Comment","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222797133_Strong_Approximation_Theorems_for_Density_Dependent_Markov_Chains","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228392770_Random_combinatorial_structures_and_prime_factorizations","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220358188_The_Poisson-Dirichlet_Distribution_And_The_Scale-Invariant_Poisson_Process","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265950086_Point_processes_generated_by_order_statistics_and_their_applications","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243070421_The_Fundamental_Limit_Theorems_in_Probability","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38360735_The_Cycle_Structure_of_Random_Permutations","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247257304_Probailistic_Methods_in_the_Theory_of_Numbers","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242920051_Approximate_Formulas_for_Some_Functions_of_Prime_Numbers","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223125323_Analysis_of_a_simple_factorization_algorithm"]}
