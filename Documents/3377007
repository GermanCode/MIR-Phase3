{"id":3377007,"title":"Fast-convergence filtered regressor algorithms for blind equalisation","authors":["Scott C. Douglas","Andrzej Cichocki","Shun-ichi Amari"],"_abstract":"The authors present a simple extension of the standard Bussgang blind equalisation algorithms that significantly improves their convergence properties. The technique uses the inverse channel estimate to filter the regressor signal. The modified algorithms provide quasi-Newton convergence in the vicinity of a local minimum of the chosen cost function with only a modest increase in the overall computational complexity of the system. An example of the technique as applied to the constant-modulus algorithm indicates its superior convergence behaviour","cited_in":[{"id":237555671,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237555671_Blind_Source_Recovery_State_Space_Formulations_A_Final_Report_submitted_to_the_IEEE_NNC_as_the_recipient_of_2001_Summer_Research_Support_Grant"},{"id":41020839,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41020839_Nonlinear_functions_for_blind_separation_and_equalization"},{"id":3717843,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3717843_Quasi-Newton_filtered-error_and_filtered-regressor_algorithms_for_adaptive_equalization_and_deconvolution"},{"id":3748939,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3748939_On_the_relationship_between_blind_deconvolution_and_blind_source_separation"},{"id":3765663,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3765663_Kuicnet_Algorithms_for_Blind_Deconvolution"},{"id":3753606,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3753606_Relationships_between_instantaneous_blind_source_separation_and_multichannel_blind_deconvolution"},{"id":2985436,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2985436_Adaptive_blind_signal_processing_-_Neural_network_approaches"},{"id":263190245,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263190245_Neural_networks_for_blind_separation_with_unknown_number_of_sources_-_An_adaptive_algorithm_based_on_neuromimetic_architecture"},{"id":220552429,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220552429_Neural_networks_for_blind_separation_with_unknown_number_of_sources"},{"id":3807886,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3807886_Adaptive_multichannel_blind_deconvolution_using_state-space_models"},{"id":3317184,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3317184_Self-Whitening_Adaptive_Equalization_and_Deconvolution_Algorithms"},{"id":226754472,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226754472_Gradient_Adaptive_Algorithms_for_Contrast-Based_Blind_Deconvolution"},{"id":2433873,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2433873_Natural_Gradient_Works_Efficiently_in_Learning"},{"id":4071740,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4071740_Natural_gradient_blind_deconvolution_and_equalization_using_causal_FIR_filters"},{"id":220540161,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220540161_Gradient_Adaptive_Paraunitary_Filter_Banks_for_Spatio-Temporal_Subspace_Analysis_and_Multichannel_Blind_Deconvolution"}],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3028768_Robust_identification_of_a_nonminimum_phase_system_Blind_adjustment_of_a_linear_equalizer_in_data_communication"]}
