{"id":277282943,"title":"Recurrent Neural Net Learning and Vanishing Gradient","authors":["Sepp Hochreiter"],"_abstract":"Recurrent nets are in principle capable to store past inputs to produce the currently desired output. This recurrent net property is used in time series prediction and process control. Practical applications involve temporal dependencies spanning many time steps between relevant inputs and desired outputs. In this case, however, gradient descent learning methods take to much time. The learning time problem appears because the error vanishes as it gets propagated back. The decaying error flow is theoretically analyzed. Then methods trying to overcome vanishing gradient are mentioned. Finally, experiments comparing conventional algorithms and alternative methods are presented. Experiments using advanced methods show that learning long time lags problems can be done in reasonable time.","cited_in":[{"id":238720759,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238720759_Speech_Audio_Image_and_Biomedical_Signal_Processing_using_Neural_Networks"},{"id":261038568,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261038568_Gamelan_music_onset_detection_using_Elman_Network"},{"id":263704884,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263704884_Searching_for_Exotic_Particles_in_High-Energy_Physics_with_Deep_Learning"},{"id":284579051,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284579051_Fast_and_Accurate_Deep_Network_Learning_by_Exponential_Linear_Units_ELUs"}],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2461396_Credit_Assignment_through_Time_Alternatives_to_Backpropagation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5583935_Learning_Long-Term_Dependencies_with_Gradient_Descent_Is_Difficult","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243698906_Finite_State_Automata_and_Simple_Recurrent_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221619530_A_Theory_for_Neural_Networks_with_Time_Delays","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222449846_Finding_Structure_in_Time","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239062408_The_Cascade-Correlation_Learning_Algorithm","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277298117_Bridging_Long_Time_Lags_by_Weight_Guessing_and_Long_Short_Term_Memory","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221620298_LSTM_can_solve_hard_long_time_lag_problems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2926596_Induction_of_Multiscale_Temporal_Structure","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238833309_Learning_State_Space_Trajectories_in_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5589638_Gradient_calculation_for_dynamic_recurrent_neural_networks_A_survey","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2456359_Holographic_Recurrent_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3301807_Neurocontrol_of_nonlinear_dynamical_systems_with_Kalman_filter_trained_recurrent_networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2743540_Learning_Sequential_Tasks_by_Incrementally_Adding_Higher_Orders","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243683010_The_utility_driven_dynamic_error_propagation_network","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277295865_Guessing_Can_Outperform_Many_Long_Time_Lag_Algorithms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2789568_A_Fixed_Size_Storage_On_Time_Complexity_Learning_Algorithm_for_Fully_Recurrent_Continually_Running_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220500234_Learning_Complex_Extended_Sequences_Using_the_Principle_of_History_Compression","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224740344_Encoding_sequential_structure_experience_with_the_real-time_recurrent_learning_algorithm","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221619153_Time_Warping_Invariant_Neural_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220500076_Induction_of_Finite-State_Languages_Using_Second-Order_Recurrent_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243683189_Complexity_of_exact_gradient_computation_algorithms_for_recurrent_neural_networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2794656_Gradient-Based_Learning_Algorithms_for_Recurrent_Networks_and_Their_Computational_Complexity"]}
