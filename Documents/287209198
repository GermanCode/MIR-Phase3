{"id":287209198,"title":"Kullback-Leibler Proximal Variational Inference","authors":["Mohammad Emtiyaz Khan","Pierre Baqu√©","Francois Fleuret","Pascal Fua"],"_abstract":"ABSTRACT We propose a new variational inference method based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) proximal term. We make two contributions towards improving efficiency of variational inference. Firstly, we derive a KL proximal-point algorithm and show its equivalence to gradient descent with natural gradient in stochastic variational inference. Secondly, we use the proximal framework to derive efficient variational algorithms for non-conjugate models. We propose a splitting procedure to separate non-conjugate terms from conjugate ones. We then linearize the non-conjugate terms and show that the resulting subproblem admits a closed-form solution. Overall, our approach converts a non-conjugate model to subproblems that involve inference in well-known conjugate models. We apply our method to many models and derive generalizations for non-conjugate exponential family. Applications to real-world datasets show that our proposed algorithms are easy to implement, fast to converge, perform well, and reduce computations.","cited_in":[],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228092206_Stochastic_Variational_Inference","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228083473_Fixed-Form_Variational_Posterior_Approximation_through_Stochastic_Linear_Regression","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259528495_Black_Box_Variational_Inference","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200744767_Online_Model_Selection_Based_on_the_Variational_Bayes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320926_Approximate_Riemannian_Conjugate_Gradient_Learning_for_Fixed-Form_Variational_Bayes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3080172_Kullback_proximal_algorithms_for_maximum-likelihood_estimation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220442791_An_Analysis_of_the_EM_Algorithm_and_Entropy-Like_Proximal_Point_Methods","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/246554763_Convergence_of_Proximal-Like_Algorithms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221346060_Message-passing_for_graph-structured_linear_programs_Proximal_projections_convergence_and_rounding_schemes_Technical_Report","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279808509_D-MFVI_Distributed_Mean_Field_Variational_Inference_using_Bregman_ADMM","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278048448_Scalable_Bayesian_Inference_via_Particle_Mirror_Descent","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277333959_A_trust-region_method_for_stochastic_variational_inference_with_applications_to_streaming_data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258816388_Revisiting_Natural_Gradient_for_Deep_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280104294_On_the_Convergence_of_Stochastic_Variational_Inference_in_Bayesian_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272194748_Proximal_Algorithms_in_Statistics_and_Machine_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2626342_Bayesian_Non-Linear_Independent_Component_Analysis_by_Multi-Layer_Perceptrons","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230883295_Variational_Inference_in_Nonconjugate_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/50247083_Large_Scale_Bayesian_Inference_and_Experimental_Design_for_Sparse_Linear_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221619981_Unsupervised_Variational_Bayesian_Learning_of_Nonlinear_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283471404_Convergence_of_Proximal-Gradient_Stochastic_Variational_Inference_under_Non-Decreasing_Step-Size_Sequence","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221621725_Gaussian_Processes_in_Machine_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221346428_Piecewise_Bounds_for_Estimating_Bernoulli-Logistic_Latent_Gaussian_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286711003_Decoupled_variational_Gaussian_inference","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320078_Concave_Gaussian_Variational_Approximations_for_Inference_in_Large-Scale_Bayesian_Linear_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237197993_Bregman_Alternating_Direction_Method_of_Multipliers"]}
