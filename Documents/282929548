{"id":282929548,"title":"Lie Algebra-Based Kinematic Prior for 3D Human Pose Tracking","authors":["E. Simo-Serra","Carme Torras","F. Moreno-Noguer"],"_abstract":"ABSTRACT We propose a novel kinematic prior for 3D human pose tracking that allows predicting the position in subsequent frames given the current position. We first define a Riemannian manifold that models the pose and extend it with its Lie algebra to also be able to represent the kinematics. We then learn a joint Gaussian mixture model of both the human pose and the kinematics on this manifold. Finally by conditioning the kinematics on the pose we are able to obtain a distribution of poses for subsequent frames that which can be used as a reliable prior in 3D human pose tracking. Our model scales well to large amounts of data and can be sampled at over 100,000 samples/second. We show it outperforms the widely used Gaussian diffusion model on the challenging Human3.6M dataset.","cited_in":[],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2561561_Estimating_Articulated_Human_Motion_With_Covariance_Scaled_Sampling","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221619263_Gaussian_Process_Dynamical_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276376655_DaLI_Deformation_and_Light_Invariant_Descriptor","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320714_Probabilistic_Non-linear_Principal_Component_Analysis_with_Gaussian_Process_Latent_Variable_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261276854_A_Joint_Model_for_2D_and_3D_Pose_Estimation_from_a_Single_Image","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261154756_Single_image_3D_human_pose_estimation_from_noisy_observations","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220659856_3D_Human_Motion_Tracking_with_a_Coordinated_Mixture_of_Factor_Analyzers","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221363090_Monocular_3D_pose_estimation_and_tracking_by_detection_In_CVPR","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4246099_3D_People_Tracking_with_Gaussian_Process_Dynamical_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41781406_A_Unifying_View_of_Sparse_Approximate_Gaussian_Process_Regression","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221110156_Latent_structured_models_for_human_pose_estimation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269935583_Fracking_Deep_Convolutional_Image_Descriptors","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221365007_Dynamical_Binary_Latent_Variable_Models_for_3D_Human_Pose_Tracking","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220659570_Articulated_Body_Motion_Capture_by_Stochastic_Search","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225396085_Optimization_and_Filtering_for_Human_Motion_Capture","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259350447_Human36M_Large_Scale_Datasets_and_Predictive_Methods_for_3D_Human_Sensing_in_Natural_Environments","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257093265_Natural_metrics_and_least-committed_priors_for_articulated_tracking","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225976910_Loose-limbed_People_Estimating_3D_Human_Pose_and_Motion_Using_Non-parametric_Belief_Propagation"]}
