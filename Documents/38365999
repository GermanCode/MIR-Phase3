{"id":38365999,"title":"Asymptotic Behavior of Expected Sample Size in Certain One Sided Tests","authors":["R. H. Farrell"],"_abstract":"Let $R$ be the set of real numbers, $\\mathscr{B}_1$ the set of Borel sets of $R$, and $\\mu$ a $\\sigma$-finite nonnegative measure on $\\mathscr{B}_1$. Let $\\Omega$ be an open real number interval (which may be infinite). Throughout we consider a Koopman-Darmois family \\begin{equation*}\\tag{1}\\{h(\\theta) \\exp (\\theta x), \\theta \\varepsilon \\Omega\\}\\end{equation*} of generalized probability density functions on the measure space $(R, \\mathscr{B}_1, \\mu)$. We consider one sided tests $T$ of the hypothesis $\\theta < 0$ against the alternative $\\theta > 0$. In general, in this paper, $T$ will be a sequential procedure. Associated with $T$ is a stopping variable $N$ (mention of the dependence of $N$ on $T$ is usually omitted). $N \\geqq 0. N = n$ means that sampling stopped after $n$ observations and a decision was made. In this context we consider $\\infty$ to be an integer, and $N = \\infty$ means that sampling does not stop. In the discussion of Section 1 we will assume that if $\\theta \\varepsilon \\Omega$ and $\\theta \\neq 0$ then $P_\\theta(N < \\infty) = 1$, that is, sampling stops with probability one. The reason for the exclusion of $\\theta = 0$ will become apparent in Section 1. We will be concerned with two events, decide $\\theta < 0$, and, decide $\\theta > 0$. The main result of this paper may be stated as follows. Theorem 1. Suppose $(R, \\mathscr{B}_1, \\mu), \\Omega$, and $\\{h(\\theta) \\exp (\\theta x), \\theta \\varepsilon \\Omega\\}$ are as described above. Define \\begin{align*}\\mu_\\theta = \\int^\\infty_{-\\infty} h(\\theta)x \\exp(\\theta x)\\mu(dx), \\\\ \\tag{2} \\\\ \\sigma^2 = \\int^\\infty_{-\\infty} h(0)x^2\\mu(dx),\\end{align*} and assume $\\mu_0 = 0$. Suppose $0 < \\alpha < 1$ and $0 < \\beta < 1$ and \\begin{equation*}\\tag{3}\\sup_{\\theta > 0} P_\\theta (\\text{ decide } \\theta < 0) \\leqq \\beta;\\quad \\sup_{\\theta < 0} P_\\theta (\\text{ decide } \\theta > 0) \\leqq \\alpha.\\end{equation*} Then \\begin{align*}\\lim \\sup_{\\theta \\rightarrow 0+} \\mu^2_\\theta|\\log|\\log\\mid\\mu_\\theta|\\|^{-1}E_\\theta N \\geqq 2\\sigma^2 P_0(N &= \\infty); \\\\ \\tag{4} \\lim \\sup_{\\theta \\rightarrow 0-} \\mu^2_\\theta|\\log|\\log\\mid\\mu_\\theta|\\|^{-1}E_\\theta N \\geqq 2\\sigma^2 P_0(N &= \\infty).\\end{align*} If $\\alpha + \\beta < 1$ there is a generalized sequential probability ratio test $T$ with stopping variable $N$ such that for the test $T$, \\begin{equation*}\\tag{5}P_0(N = \\infty) = 1 - (\\alpha + \\beta);\\quad (3) \\text{ holds };\\end{equation*} for the test $T$, \\begin{equation*}\\tag{6}\\lim_{\\theta \\rightarrow 0} \\mu^2_\\theta|\\log|\\log\\mid\\mu_\\theta|\\|^{-1}E_\\theta N = 2\\sigma^2 P_0(N = \\infty).\\end{equation*} For all tests $T$, if $P_0(N = \\infty) > 0$ then $\\lim_{\\theta \\rightarrow 0} \\theta^2E_\\theta N = \\infty$. In Section 1, (7) and (8), it is shown that $P_0(N = \\infty) \\geqq 1 - \\alpha - \\beta$. Consequently the relations (4) and (5) of Theorem 1 are not vacuous. We were led to formulate Theorem 1 by a problem of constructing bounded length confidence intervals. The relationship is explained in Section 2. The proof of Theorem 1 is given in Section 3.","cited_in":[{"id":259478458,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259478458_lil'_UCB_An_Optimal_Exploration_Algorithm_for_Multi-Armed_Bandits"},{"id":237276412,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237276412_Martingales_in_Sequential_Analysis_and_Time_Series_19451985"},{"id":7187520,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7187520_Iterated_logarithm_inequalities"},{"id":7187532,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7187532_Inequalities_for_the_sequence_of_sample_means"},{"id":38365149,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38365149_Some_One-Sided_Stopping_Rules"},{"id":30765793,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/30765793_Open-Ended_Tests_for_Koopman-Darmois_Families"},{"id":38357790,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38357790_The_Expected_Sample_Size_of_Some_Tests_of_Power_One"},{"id":38358010,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38358010_Approximations_to_the_Expected_Sample_Size_of_Certain_Sequential_Tests"},{"id":38358039,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38358039_On_Confidence_Sequences"},{"id":38358232,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38358232_Power-One_Tests_Based_on_Sample_Sums"},{"id":38358344,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38358344_Optimality_and_Almost_Optimality_of_Mixture_Stopping_Rules"},{"id":38358579,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38358579_Asymptotic_Expected_Inferior_Sample_Size_of_a_Sequential_Test_Involving_Two_Populations"},{"id":225921486,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225921486_Asymptotic_densities_of_stopping_times_associated_with_tests_of_power_one"},{"id":240925027,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240925027_28_Sequential_nonparametric_tests"},{"id":227424973,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227424973_A_martingale_approach_for_detecting_the_drift_of_a_Wiener_process"},{"id":38348878,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38348878_Herbert_Robbins_and_sequential_analysis"},{"id":251638548,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/251638548_Martingales_in_Sequential_Analysis_and_Time_Series_1945-1985"},{"id":269307620,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269307620_Best-arm_identification_algorithms_for_multi-armed_bandits_in_the_fixed_confidence_setting"}],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38366835_Distinguishability_of_Sets_of_Distributions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38367996_Sequential_Tests_of_Statistical_Hypotheses","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38366362_Bounded_Length_Confidence_Intervals_for_the_Zero_of_a_Regression_Function","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38367196_Ordered_Families_of_Distributions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230502238_Confidence_intervals_of_preassigned_length_for_quantiles_of_unimodal_populations","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38367397_Testing_one_Simple_Hypothesis_Against_Another","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243771334_Fourier_analys_of_distribution_functions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38367913_Differentiation_Under_the_Expectation_Sign_in_the_Fundamental_Identity_of_Sequential_Analysis"]}
