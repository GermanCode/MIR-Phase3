Klein","Shayegan Omidshafiei","Jonathan How"],"_abstract":"ABSTRACT This paper presents a camera control approach for learning unknown nonlinear target dynamics by approximating information value functions using particles that represent targets' position distributions. The target dynamics are described by a non-parametric mixture model that can learn a potentially infinite number of motion patterns. Assuming that each motion pattern can be represented as a velocity field, the target behaviors can be described by a non-parametric Dirichlet process-Gaussian process (DP-GP) mixture model. The DP-GP model has been successfully applied for clustering time-invariant spatial phenomena due to its flexibility to adapt to data complexity without overfitting. A new DP-GP information value function is presented that can be used by the sensor to explore and improve the DP-GP mixture model. The optimal camera control is computed to maximize this information value function online via a computationally efficient particle-based search method. The proposed approach is demonstrated through numerical simulations and hardware experiments in the RAVEN testbed at MIT.","cited_in":[],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/252776282_An_Information_Potential_Approach_for_Tracking_and_Surveilling_Multiple_Moving_Targets_using_Mobile_Sensor_Agents","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224252865_Bearing-only_Target_Tracking_using_a_Bank_of_MAP_Estimators","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222579717_Optimal_sensor_placement_and_motion_coordination_for_target_tracking","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200045331_An_Introduction_to_the_Kalman_Filter","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2445827_A_New_Extension_of_the_Kalman_Filter_to_Nonlinear_Systems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229022875_Control_of_nonholonomic_mobile_robot_backstepping_kinematics_into_dynamics","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3024329_Tracking_and_Regulation_Control_of_an_Underactuated_Surface_Vessel_With_Nonintegrable_Dynamics","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262497772_A_Geometric_Transversals_Approach_to_Analyzing_the_Probability_of_Track_Detection_for_Maneuvering_Targets","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220473947_A_Bayesian_Nonparametric_Approach_to_Modeling_Motion_Patterns","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220062175_An_Information_Roadmap_Method_for_Robotic_Sensor_Path_Planning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263047159_An_Information_Value_Function_for_Nonparametric_Gaussian_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221345109_Nonmyopic_active_learning_of_Gaussian_processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220814571_Efficient_Planning_of_Informative_Paths_for_Multiple_Robots","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221064452_Unfreezing_the_Robot_Navigation_in_Dense_Interacting_Crowds","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224108430_On_Trajectory_Optimization_for_Active_Sensing_in_Gaussian_Process_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41781559_Gaussian_Process_for_Machine_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248512106_Pattern_Recognition_and_Machine_Learning_Errata","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/32896369_Hierarchical_Dirichlet_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38357634_A_Bayesian_Analysis_of_Some_Non-Parametric_Problems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/246100685_Estimation_With_Applications_to_Tracking_and_Navigation_Algorithms_and_Software_for_Information_Ext","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222648499_Wireless_Sensor_Network_Survey","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229100346_Markov_Chain_Sampling_Methods_for_Dirichlet_Process_Mixture_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254212736_Variational_inference_for_Dirichlet_process_mixtures_Bayesian_Anal_1121-144","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221996674_The_Infinite_Gaussian_Mixture_Model","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2538401_Infinite_Mixtures_of_Gaussian_Process_Experts","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2873720_Hierarchical_Topic_Models_and_the_Nested_Chinese_Restaurant_Process","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228762393_Multi-platform_information-based_sensor_management","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4986684_Bayesian_Nonparametric_Spatial_Modeling_With_Dirichlet_Process_Mixing","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236955038_Dynamic_Clustering_via_Asymptotics_of_the_Dependent_Dirichlet_Process_Mixture","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243773601_Beyond_the_Kalman_Filter-Particle_Filters_for_Tracking_Applications","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3003931_Multitarget_tracking_using_the_joint_multitarget_probability_density","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262153584_Information_Theoretic_Sensor_Data_Selection_for_Active_Object_Recognition_and_State_Estimation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51773534_A_Comparison_of_Information_Functions_and_Search_Strategies_for_Sensor_Planning_in_Target_Classification","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320007_Near-Optimal_Sensor_Placements_in_Gaussian_Processes_Theory_Efficient_Algorithms_and_Empirical_Studies","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3619563_Control_of_a_Nonholonomic_Mobile_Robot_Backstepping_Kinematics_Into_Dynamic","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285214264_A_geometric_transversals_approach_to_analyzing_the_probability_of_track_detection_for_maneuvering_targets","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3002974_Sequential_track_extraction"]}
