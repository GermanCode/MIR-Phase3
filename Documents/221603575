{"id":221603575,"title":"A General Method for Reducing the Complexity of Relational Inference And its Application to MCMC","authors":["Hoifung Poon","Pedro Domingos","Marc Sumner"],"_abstract":"Many real-world problems are characterized by complex rela- tional structure, which can be succinctly represented in fir st- order logic. However, many relational inference algorithms proceed by first fully instantiating the first-order theory a nd then working at the propositional level. The applicability of such approaches is severely limited by the exponential time and memory cost of propositionalization. Singla and Domin- gos (2006) addressed this by developing a \"lazy\" version of the WalkSAT algorithm, which grounds atoms and clauses only as needed. In this paper we generalize their ideas to a much broader class of algorithms, including other types of SAT solvers and probabilistic inference methods like MCMC. Lazy inference is potentially applicable whenever variables and functions have default values (i.e., a value that is much more frequent than the others). In relational domains, the default is false for atoms and true for clauses. We illustrat e our framework by applying it to MC-SAT, a state-of-the-art MCMC algorithm. Experiments on a number of real-world domains show that lazy inference reduces both space and time by several orders of magnitude, making probabilistic rela- tional inference applicable in previously infeasible domains.","cited_in":[{"id":275346233,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275346233_Exploiting_Determinism_to_Scale_Relational_Inference"},{"id":261040911,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261040911_Learning_to_Refine_an_Automatically_Extracted_Knowledge_Base_Using_Markov_Logic"},{"id":221653537,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221653537_Web_information_extraction_using_Markov_logic_networks"},{"id":221417870,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221417870_Simultaneous_Tracking_and_Activity_Recognition"},{"id":221604130,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221604130_Coarse-to-Fine_Inference_and_Learning_for_First-Order_Probabilistic_Models"},{"id":220874817,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220874817_Large-Scale_Cross-Document_Coreference_Using_Distributed_Inference_and_Hierarchical_Models"},{"id":221609526,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221609526_Relational_network-service_clustering_analysis_with_set_evidences"},{"id":235673412,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235673412_Lifted_Message_Passing_for_Satisfiability"},{"id":221012925,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221012925_Joint_Unsupervised_Coreference_Resolution_with_Markov_Logic"},{"id":266232557,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266232557_Building_a_Real-Time_System_for_High-Level_Person_Recognition"},{"id":242140616,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242140616_Option_Discovery_in_Hierarchical_Reinforcement_Learning_for_Training_Large_Factor_Graphs_for_Information_Extraction"},{"id":239926025,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239926025_Learning_and_Inference_in_WEIGHTED_LOGIC_WITH_APPLICATION_TO_NATURAL_LANGUAGE_PROCESSING"},{"id":242094590,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242094590_Discriminative_Learning_with_Markov_Logic_Networks"},{"id":50927954,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/50927954_Simultaneous_Tracking_and_Activity_Recognition_with_Relational_Dynamic_Bayesian_Networks"},{"id":266588837,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266588837_Algorithms_for_Collective_Knowledge_Acquisition"},{"id":221475195,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221475195_Discriminative_Structure_Learning_of_Markov_Logic_Networks"},{"id":220812553,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220812553_Speeding_Up_Inference_in_Markov_Logic_Networks_by_Preprocessing_to_Reduce_the_Size_of_the_Resulting_Grounded_Network"},{"id":221618661,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221618661_FACTORIE_Probabilistic_Programming_via_Imperatively_Defined_Factor_Graphs"},{"id":261465173,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261465173_Relations_to_improve_multi-target_tracking_in_an_activity_recognition_system"},{"id":220696276,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220696276_Markov_Logic_An_Interface_Layer_for_Artificial_Intelligence"},{"id":220698781,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220698781_Bi-directional_Joint_Inference_for_Entity_Resolution_and_Segmentation_Using_Imperatively-Defined_Factor_Graphs"},{"id":226845571,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226845571_Markov_Logic_A_Language_and_Algorithms_for_Link_Mining"},{"id":221328307,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221328307_A_Novel_Structure_Refining_Algorithm_for_Statistical-Logical_Models"},{"id":221559385,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221559385_From_Information_to_Knowledge_Harvesting_Entities_and_Relationships_from_Web_Sources"},{"id":220774732,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220774732_Generative_Structure_Learning_for_Markov_Logic_Networks"},{"id":262334310,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262334310_Empirical_studies_in_learning_to_read"},{"id":262401559,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262401559_Supporting_rule-based_representations_with_corpus-derived_lexical_information"},{"id":225907586,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225907586_Discriminative_Markov_Logic_Network_Structure_Learning_Based_on_Propositionalization_and_ch2-Test"},{"id":221404108,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221404108_Probabilistic_Theorem_Proving"},{"id":220269760,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220269760_Interactive_reasoning_in_uncertain_RDF_knowledge_bases"},{"id":221510736,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221510736_Database_Foundations_for_Scalable_RDF_Processing"},{"id":220204915,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220204915_Boosting_learning_and_inference_in_Markov_logic_through_metaheuristics"},{"id":51888036,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51888036_Tuffy_Scaling_up_Statistical_Inference_in_Markov_Logic_Networks_usingan_RDBMS"},{"id":222527526,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222527526_Rethinking_cognitive_architecture_via_graphical_models"},{"id":51931976,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publicati
