{"id":242486770,"title":"Bayesian Nonparametric Regression for Diabetes Deaths","authors":[],"_abstract":"Poisson regression models are commonly used in actuarial science to model count data (e.g., the number of claims) and covariates. The standard parametric formulation assumes that the response to covariates is constant across the population under study. Additionally, the shape of the posterior distribution is rather inflexible. In practice, however, the response to covariates may depend on a latent class and the posterior dis- tribution may be highly nonparametric. We propose a Bayesian nonparametric model in which a Dirichlet process prior on the regression coecients leads to a clustering of observations into groups having the same response to covariates. We illustrate the utility of our approach with an example dataset of diabetes deaths.","cited_in":[],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229100346_Markov_Chain_Sampling_Methods_for_Dirichlet_Process_Mixture_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224910613_Adaptive_Rejection_Sampling_for_Gibbs_Sampling","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224910614_Adaptive_Rejection_Metropolis_Sampling_Within_Gibbs_Sampling","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236901854_Understanding_the_Metropolis-Hastings_Algorithm","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241251898_An_Improved_Criterion_for_Clustering_Based_on_the_Posterior_Similarity_Matrix","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/31002185_Bayesian_Cluster_Analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38326987_Nonparametric_Bayesian_Data_Analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38357634_A_Bayesian_Analysis_of_Some_Non-Parametric_Problems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38357862_Antoniak_CE_Mixtures_of_Dirichlet_Processes_with_Applications_to_Bayesian_Nonparametric_Problems_Ann_Stat_2_1152-1174","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221669734_Equations_of_State_Calculations_by_Fast_Computing_Machines"]}
