{"id":222695635,"title":"Structured neural network modelling of multi-valued functions for wind retrieval from scatterometer measurements","authors":["David J. Evans","Dan Cornford","Ian T Nabney"],"_abstract":"A conventional neural network approach to regression problems approximates the conditional mean of the output vector. For mappings which are multi-valued this approach breaks down, since the average of two solutions is not necessarily a valid solution. In this article mixture density networks, a principled method for modelling conditional probability density functions, are applied to retrieving Cartesian wind vector components from satellite scatterometer data. A hybrid mixture density network is implemented to incorporate prior knowledge of the predominantly bimodal function branches. An advantage of a fully probabilistic model is that more sophisticated and principled methods can be used to resolve ambiguities.","cited_in":[{"id":227606382,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227606382_Bayesian_Analysis_of_the_Scatterometer_Wind_Retrieval_Inverse_Problem"},{"id":222536347,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222536347_Bayesian_inference_for_wind_field_retrieval"},{"id":40498303,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/40498303_Multi-valued_control_problems_and_mixture_density_network"},{"id":43798224,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/43798224_Bayesian_retrieval_of_scatterometer_wind_fields"},{"id":40498309,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/40498309_Conditional_distribution_modeling_for_estimating_and_exploiting_uncertainty_in_control_systems"},{"id":228783341,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228783341_Online_learning_of_wind-field_models"},{"id":33776225,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/33776225_Continuous_latent_variable_models_for_dimensionality_reduction_and_sequential_data_reconstruction"},{"id":220550771,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220550771_Empirical_transfer_function_determination_by_the_use_of_multilayer_perceptron"},{"id":40498250,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/40498250_Online_Approximations_for_Wind-Field_Models"},{"id":40498273,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/40498273_Gaussian_Processes_-_Iterative_Sparse_Approximations"},{"id":45688486,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45688486_Les_perceptrons_multicouches_de_la_regression_non_lineaire_aux_problemes_inverses_Dans_Voies_nouvelles_pour_lanalyse_des_donnees_en_sciences_de_lunivers_Eds_JP_Roselot_and_A_Bijaoui"},{"id":11500673,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11500673_Sparse_On-Line_Gaussian_Processes"},{"id":283672690,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283672690_Sparse_GP-based_soft_sensor_applied_to_the_power_plant"},{"id":226905342,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226905342_Data_Assimilation_with_Sequential_Gaussian_Processes"},{"id":270776816,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270776816_Probabilistic_Control_for_Uncertain_Systems"},{"id":257392767,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257392767_Comparative_study_of_a_structured_neural_network_and_an_extended_Kalman_filter_for_state_of_health_determination_of_lithium-ion_batteries_in_hybrid_electricvehicles"}],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229100226_Mixture_Models_Inference_and_Applications_to_Clustering_Dekker_New_York","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3490776_Identifiability_In_Wind_Estimation_From_Scatterometer_Measurements","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215722315_Scatterometer_data_interpretation_Derivation_of_the_transfer_function_CMOD4","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215722314_Scatterometer_Data_Interpretation_Measurement_Space_and_Inversion","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248794518_A_neural_network_approach_for_modeling_nonlinear_transfer_functions_Application_for_wind_retrieval_from_spaceborne_scatterometer_data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3625294_Modelling_conditional_probability_distributions_for_periodic_variables","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222548306_Neural_network_wind_retrieval_from_ERS-1_scatterometer_data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/40498323_Neural_Network_Based_Wind_Vector_Retrieval_from_Satellite_Scatterometer_Data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248798881_Error_modeling_and_calibration_Towards_the_true_surface_wind_speed","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222555704_A_scatterometer_neural_network_sensor_model_with_input_noise","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/253078738_The_Calibration_of_ERS-1_Satellite_Scatterometer_Winds","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242919163_Modeling_Conditional_Probability_Distributions_for_Periodic_Variables","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222536347_Bayesian_inference_for_wind_field_retrieval","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228855737_Determination_of_the_geophysical_model_function_of_the_ERS-1_scatterometer_by_the_use_of_neural_networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254331801_The_Estimation_of_Parameters_in_Non-Linear_Implicit_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3765645_Neural_network_regression_with_input_uncertainty","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215721451_Neural_Networks_For_Pattern_Recognition"]}
