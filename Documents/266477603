{"id":266477603,"title":"Multiscale Bernstein polynomials for densities","authors":["Antonio Canale","David B Dunson"],"_abstract":"Our focus is on constructing a multiscale nonparametric prior for densities. The Bayes density estimation literature is dominated by single scale methods, with the exception of Polya trees, which favor overly-spiky densities even when the truth is smooth. We propose a multiscale Bernstein polynomial family of priors, which produce smooth realizations that do not rely on hard partitioning of the support. At each level in an infinitely-deep binary tree, we place a beta dictionary density; within a scale the densities are equivalent to Bernstein polynomials. Using a stick-breaking characterization, stochastically decreasing weights are allocated to the finer scale dictionary elements. A slice sampler is used for posterior computation, and properties are described. The method characterizes densities with locally-varying smoothness, and can produce a sequence of coarse to fine density estimates. An extension for Bayesian testing of group differences is introduced and applied to DNA methylation array data.","cited_in":[],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261461865_A_fast_multiscale_framework_for_data_in_high-dimensions_Measure_estimation_anomaly_detection_and_compressive_measurements","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2468768_Flexible_Empirical_Bayes_Estimation_For_Wavelets","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2650341_Multiple_Shrinkage_and_Subset_Selection_in_Wavelets","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38348755_Density_Estimation_by_Wavelet_Thresholding","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220056512_Online_wavelet-based_density_estimation_for_non-stationary_streaming_data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2352607_Evaluating_the_Accuracy_of_Sampling-Based_Approaches_to_the_Calculation_of_Posterior_Moments","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38348291_Convergence_rates_for_density_estimation_with_Bernstein_polynomials","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4744622_Modeling_Regression_Error_With_a_Mixture_of_Polya_Trees","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261742334_Gibbs_Sampling_Methods_for_Stick-Breaking_Priors","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220286498_Slice_sampling_mixture_models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38359687_Some_Aspects_of_Polya_Tree_Distributions_for_Statistical_Modelling","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2347309_More_Aspects_of_Polya_Tree_Distributions_for_Statistical_Modelling","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235980282_Multiwavelet_density_estimation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38359686_Polya_Trees_and_Random_Distributions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258680813_Nonlinear_wavelet_density_estimation_with_censored_dependent_data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228781322_Posterior_consistency_in_conditional_distribution_estimation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2469190_Adaptive_Wavelet_Estimator_For_Nonparametric_Density_Deconvolution","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227771470_Bayesian_density_estimation_using_Bernstein_polynomials","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4788827_Random_Bernstein_Polynomials","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4772072_Consistency_of_Bernstein_polynomial_posteriors","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320766_Logistic_Stick-Breaking_Process","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228562511_Nonparametric_Bayesian_models_through_probit_stick-breaking_processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229100417_A_Constructive_Definition_of_the_Dirichlet_Prior","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4742782_Bayesian_Curve_Classification_Using_Wavelets","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227369250_Nonparametric_Bayes_Conditional_Distribution_Modeling_With_Variable_Selection"]}
