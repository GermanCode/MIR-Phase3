{"id":283279776,"title":"Scaled subordinators and generalizations of the Indian buffet process","authors":["Lancelot F. James","Peter Orbanz","Yee Whye Teh"],"_abstract":"ABSTRACT We study random families of subsets of $\\mathbb{N}$ that are similar to exchangeable random partitions, but do not require constituent sets to be disjoint: Each element of ${\\mathbb{N}}$ may be contained in multiple subsets. One class of such objects, known as Indian buffet processes, has become a popular tool in machine learning. Based on an equivalence between Indian buffet and scale-invariant Poisson processes, we identify a random scaling variable whose role is similar to that played in exchangeable partition models by the total mass of a random measure. Analogous to the construction of exchangeable partitions from normalized subordinators, random families of sets can be constructed from randomly scaled subordinators. Coupling to a heavy-tailed scaling variable induces a power law on the number of sets containing the first $n$ elements. Several examples, with properties desirable in applications, are derived explicitly. A relationship to exchangeable partitions is made precise as a correspondence between scaled subordinators and Poisson-Kingman measures, generalizing a result of Arratia, Barbour and Tavare on scale-invariant processes.","cited_in":[],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265543899_On_the_central_role_of_scale_invariant_Poisson_processes_on_0","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220270203_Infinite_Latent_Feature_Models_and_the_Indian_Buffet_Process","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265357735_Random_discrete_distributions_Discussion","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24163428_Taking_Advantage_of_Sparsity_in_Multi-Task_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221619128_Nonparametric_Latent_Feature_Models_for_Link_Prediction","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5323469_Latent_Features_in_Similarity_Judgments_A_Nonparametric_Bayesian_Approach","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3321006_Multi-Task_Learning_for_Analyzing_and_Sorting_Large_Databases_of_Sequential_Data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223803147_Order_statistics_for_jumps_of_normalised_subordinators","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2826951_The_Two_Parameter_Poisson-Dirichlet_Distribution_Derived_From_a_Stable_Subordinator","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220270095_The_Infinite_Gamma-Poisson_Feature_Model","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281076602_Bayesian_nonparametric_models_for_bipartite_graphs","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256070167_Joint_Modeling_of_Multiple_Time_Series_via_the_Beta_Process_with_Application_to_Motion_Capture_Segmentation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221346022_A_Stick-Breaking_Construction_of_the_Beta_Process","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320786_Stick-breaking_Construction_for_the_Indian_Buffet_Process","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51965593_Beta-Negative_Binomial_Process_and_Poisson_Factor_Analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228060093_Cluster_and_Feature_Modeling_from_Combinatorial_Stochastic_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38347499_An_Approximation_Theorem_for_the_Poisson_Binomial_Distribution","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38359431_Nonparametric_Bayes_Estimators_Based_on_Beta_Processes_in_Models_for_Life_History_Data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280793944_On_a_particular_class_of_self-decomposable_random_variables_the_durations_of_Bessel_excursions_straddling_independent_exponential_times","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320085_The_Indian_Buffet_Process_An_Introduction_and_Review","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271794957_On_simulation_and_properties_of_the_stable_law","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46451646_Distributional_Properties_of_means_of_Random_Probability_Measures","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240097339_Logarithmic_Combinatorial_Structures_a_Probabilistic_Approach","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38349680_Random_minimal_directed_spanning_trees_and_Dickman-type_distributions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38358395_Bayesian_Nonparametric_Estimation_Based_on_Censored_Data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279346984_An_Introduction_to_the_Theory_of_Point_Processes_Vol_II","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220358188_The_Poisson-Dirichlet_Distribution_And_The_Scale-Invariant_Poisson_Process","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220321011_Hierarchical_Beta_Processes_and_the_Indian_Buffet_Process","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221619194_Modeling_Dyadic_Data_with_Binary_Latent_Factors","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259528657_The_combinatorial_structure_of_beta_negative_binomial_processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221619853_Indian_Buffet_Processes_with_Power-law_Behavior","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51936102_Beta_Processes_Stick-Breaking_and_Power_Laws","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257308543_Central_Limit_Theorems_for_an_Indian_Buffet_Model_with_Random_Weights"]}
