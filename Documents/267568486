{"id":267568486,"title":"Miscellanea: Generalized Ewens-Pitman model for Bayesian clustering","authors":["Harry Dominic Crane"],"_abstract":"ABSTRACT 5 SUMMARY We propose a Bayesian method for clustering from discrete data structures that commonly arise in genetics and other applications. This method is equivariant with respect to relabeling units; unsampled units do not interfere with sampled data; and missing data do not hinder infer-ence. Cluster inference using the posterior mode performs well on simulated and real data sets, 10 and the posterior predictive distribution enables supervised learning based on a partial clustering of the sample.","cited_in":[{"id":280311472,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280311472_The_ubiquitous_Ewens_sampling_formula"}],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265505693_Model-Based_Gaussian_and_Non-Gaussian_Clustering","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230996389_Convergence_Rates_of_Markov_Chains_on_Spaces_of_Partitions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/18499361_Ewens_WJ_The_Sampling_Theory_of_Selectively_Neutral_Alleles_Theoret_Popul_Biol_3_87-112","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200101672_Inferring_Phylogenies","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/17835231_The_Construction_of_Phylogenetic_Trees","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2348531_On_Bayesian_analysis_of_mixture_with_unknown_number_of_components","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/10694705_A_pattern_analysis_of_the_second_Rehnquist_US_Supreme_Court","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227369320_Identifying_Intra-Party_Voting_Blocs_in_the_UK_House_of_Commons","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/22439656_Similarity_of_Dendrograms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/30962620_Did_Shakespeare_Write_a_Newly-Discovered_Poem","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228365391_Bayesian_generalized_product_partition_model","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262157385_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266988609_Species_sampling_models_Consistency_for_the_number_of_species","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/31448218_Estimating_the_Number_of_Unsen_Species_How_Many_Words_Did_Shakespeare_Know","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265364685_Product_Partition_Models_for_Normal_Means","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4993277_Bayesian_clustering_and_product_partition_models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261815374_Model-Based_Clustering_Discriminant_Analysis_and_Density_Estimation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/31002185_Bayesian_Cluster_Analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220682848_Least_Squares_Quantization_in_PCM's","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/216849882_The_Relation_Between_the_Number_of_Species_and_the_Number_of_Individuals","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/30962688_The_Number_of_New_Species_and_the_Increase_in_Population_Coverage_When_a_Sample_is_Increased","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4993356_Clustering_Using_Objective_Functions_and_Stochastic_Search","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247027179_On_the_Asymptotic_Distribution_of_Large_Prime_Factors","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51939193_Classification_based_on_a_permanental_process_with_cyclic_approximation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7191171_A_Factorial_Study_of_the_Supreme_Court","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38348841_What_is_statistical_model","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267437663_Objective_Priors_for_Discrete_Parameter_Spaces","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38359626_Product_Partition_Models_for_Change_Point_Problems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238866541_Partition_models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267568658_Clustering_From_Categorical_Data_Sequences"]}
