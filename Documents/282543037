{"id":282543037,"title":"Big data analytics in the cloud: Spark on Hadoop vs MPI/OpenMP on Beowulf","authors":["Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz","Luca Oneto","Davide Anguita"],"_abstract":"One of the biggest challenges of the current big data landscape is our inability to process vast amounts of information in a reasonable time. In this work, we explore and compare two distributed computing frameworks implemented on commodity cluster architectures: MPI/OpenMP on Beowulf that is high-performance oriented and exploits multi-machine/multicore infrastructures, and Apache Spark on Hadoop which targets iterative algorithms through in-memory computing. We use the Google Cloud Platform service to create virtual machine clusters, run the frameworks, and evaluate two supervised machine learning algorithms: KNN and Pegasos SVM. Results obtained from experiments with a particle physics data set show MPI/OpenMP outperforms Spark by more than one order of magnitude in terms of processing speed and provides more consistent performance. However, Spark shows better data management infrastructure and the possibility of dealing with other aspects such as node failure and data replication.","cited_in":[{"id":291348342,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291348342_A_nearest_neighbours-based_algorithm_for_big_time_series_data_forecasting"}],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/246924679_Nearest_Neighbor_Pattern_Classification","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220875744_Early_Experiments_with_the_OpenMPMPI_Hybrid_Programming_Model","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269162025_FMI_Fault_Tolerant_Messaging_Interface_for_Fast_and_Transparent_Recovery","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239546749_Statistical_Learning_Theory","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233764065_Shark_SQL_and_Rich_Analytics_at_Scale","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234790155_Spark_Cluster_Computing_with_Working_Sets","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221392799_Hybrid_MPIOpenMP_parallel_programming_on_clusters_of_multi-core_SMP_nodes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279556630_Do_we_Need_Hundreds_of_Classifiers_to_Solve_Real_World_Classification_Problems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224216956_Cost-Effective_HPC_The_Community_or_the_Cloud","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221996875_Kernel_Method_for_Pattern_Analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220552134_A_review_of_optimization_methodologies_in_support_vector_machines","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262233351_Resilient_distributed_datasets_A_fault-tolerant_abstraction_for_in-memory_cluster_computing","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/1918607_Fast_k_Nearest_Neighbor_Search_using_GPU","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268498026_OpenCoarrays_Open-source_Transport_Layers_Supporting_Coarray_Fortran_Compilers","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221103048_Big_Data_and_Cloud_Computing_Current_State_and_Future_Opportunities","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260354186_In-Sample_and_Out-of-Sample_Model_Selection_and_Error_Estimation_for_Support_Vector_Machines","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282707871_Nearest_neighbor_pattern_classification","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4221791_MPI_versus_MPIOpenMP_on_the_IBM_SP_for_the_NAS_Benchmarks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272825857_UCI_Machine_Learning_Repository","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260325049_Data_Mining_with_Big_Data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215721451_Neural_Networks_For_Pattern_Recognition","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320387_Distance_Metric_Learning_for_Large_Margin_Nearest_Neighbor_Classification","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215991424_Cover_trees_for_nearest_neighbor","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275466421_Choosing_l_norms_in_high-dimensional_spaces_based_on_hub_analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239279181_Portable_implementation_of_the_mpi_message_passing_interface_standard","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269268746_MIC-SVM_Designing_a_Highly_Efficient_Support_Vector_Machine_for_Advanced_Modern_Multi-core_and_Many-Core_Architectures","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263704884_Searching_for_Exotic_Particles_in_High-Energy_Physics_with_Deep_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220589628_Pegasos_Primal_estimated_sub-gradient_solver_for_SVM","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51946522_A_Reliable_Effective_Terascale_Linear_Learning_System","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220694713_Statistical_Learning_Theory","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240918764_Hadoop_The_Definitive_Guide","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234826345_Using_OpenMP_Portable_Shared_Memory_Parallel_Programming_Scientific_and_Engineering_Computation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220319989_Stability_and_Generalization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3344403_OpenMP_An_Industry-Standard_API_for_Shared-Memory_Programming","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261111580_High-Performance_and_Scalable_MPI_over_InfiniBand_with_Reduced_Memory_Usage_An_In-Depth_performance_Analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/246984932_Co-Array_Fortran_for_parallel_programming","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263894830_The_Emerging_Big_Dimensionality","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221620260_Overfitting_in_Neural_Nets_Backpropagation_Conjugate_Gradient_and_Early_Stopping","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262154234_Beyond_Parallel_Programming_with_Domain_Specific_Languages","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220953093_Programming_Distributed_Memory_Sytems_Using_OpenMP","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228075681_Hybrid_algorithms_for_instance-based_classification","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6928628_Parallel_Sequential_Minimal_Optimization_for_the_Training_of_Support_Vector_Machines"]}
