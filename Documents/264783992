{"id":264783992,"title":"Indian Sign Language Recognition using Skin Colour Detection","authors":["Ashok Kumar Sahoo","Kiran Kumar Ravulakollu"],"_abstract":"ABSTRACT Sign language recognition is an important topic of current research in today's scenario. The systems developed till now worldwide in this area are under scanner for standardization. But, the situation of automatic gesture recognition of Indian Sign Language is in its early stage. So, the focus of this research is to develop an automatic gesture recognition system for Indian Sign Language. In this paper, the focus is on the dataset development, application of various feature extraction methods in combination with skin colour detection and analysis of results of k-Nearest Neighbor and Neural Network classifiers in specific words belongs to computer terminologies of Indian Sign Language. The skin colour detection method helps us to extract hand and face portions of images from input video frames. This ignores other components available in image frames, like body parts and image background, which are not desired features for the classification. The best results obtained from k-Nearest Neighbor classifier is 97.04% with image pixel feature extraction method. An accuracy rate of 97.00% obtained in combination of image pixel feature extraction method and Neural Network classifier.","cited_in":[],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/216679417_Shape_Texture_and_Local_Movement_Hand_Gesture_Features_for_Indian_Sign_Language_Recognition","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235766181_Indian_Sign_Language_Recognition_Using_Eigen_Value_Weighted_EuclideanDistance_Based_Classification_Technique","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221296006_Hand_pose_identification_from_monocular_image_for_sign_language_recognition","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263506784_A_proposed_framework_for_Indian_Sign_Language_Recognition","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225797350_Nonparametric_Bayesian_Image_Segmentation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262187093_Sign_language_recognition_State_of_the_art","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239056767_Discriminatory_Analysis_Nonparametric_Discrimination_Consistency_Properties","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248391121_Indian_Sign_Language_Recognition","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223519735_Handwritten_character_recognition_through_two-stage_foreground_sub-sampling","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259507458_Face_detection_based_on_skin_color_likelihood","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266230683_Comparison_between_HSV_and_YCbCr_Color_Model_Color-Texture_based_Classification_of_the_Food_Grains","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224105898_Design_and_development_of_a_frame_based_MT_system_for_English-to-ISL"]}
