{"id":280033955,"title":"Scalable MCMC for Large Data Problems using Data Subsampling and the Difference Estimator","authors":["Matias Quiroz","Mattias Villani","Robert Kohn"],"_abstract":"We propose a generic Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to speed up computations for datasets with many observations. A key feature of our approach is the use of the highly efficient difference estimator from the survey sampling literature to estimate the log-likelihood accurately using only a small fraction of the data. Our algorithm improves on the $O(n)$ complexity of regular MCMC by operating over local data clusters instead of the full sample when computing the likelihood. The likelihood estimate is used in a Pseudo-marginal framework to sample from a perturbed posterior which is within $O(m^{-1/2})$ of the true posterior, where $m$ is the subsample size. The method is applied to a logistic regression model to predict firm bankruptcy for a large data set. We document a significant speed up in comparison to the standard MCMC on the full dataset.","cited_in":[],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239578406_Algorithms_for_Computing_the_Sample_Variance_Analysis_and_Recommendations","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232062873_Efficient_implementation_of_Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo_when_using_an_unbiased_likelihood_estimator","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236235190_Austerity_in_MCMC_Land_Cutting_the_Metropolis-Hastings_Budget","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261065671_Firefly_Monte_Carlo_Exact_MCMC_with_subsets_of_data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265907991_Scalable_and_Robust_Bayesian_Inference_via_the_Median_Posterior","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258631741_Asymptotically_Exact_Embarrassingly_Parallel_MCMC","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257146976_On_some_properties_of_Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo_simulation_methods_based_on_the_particle_filter","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46154966_CODA_Convergence_diagnosis_and_output_analysis_for_MCMC","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/44816799_Moel_Assisted_Survey_Sampling","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257142847_On_the_efficiency_of_pseudo-marginal_random_walk_Metropolis_algorithms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260957174_Importance_Sampling_Squared_for_Bayesian_Inference_in_Latent_Variable_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224910629_Sampling-Based_Approaches_to_Calculate_Marginal_Densities","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268524871_Bayesian_Big_Data_Classification_A_Review_with_Complements","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263012108_Accelerating_Metropolis-Hastings_algorithms_Delayed_acceptance_with_prefetching","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220851866_MapReduce_Simplified_Data_Processing_on_Large_Clusters","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235961592_Generalised_Linear_Model","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261700795_Speeding_Up_MCMC_by_Efficient_Data_Subsampling","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24168169_The_pseudo-marginal_approach_for_effcient_Monte_Carlo_computations","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38368077_On_the_Theory_of_Sampling_from_Finite_Populations"]}
