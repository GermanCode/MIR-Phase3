{"id":284898760,"title":"Multiview Triplet Embedding: Learning Attributes in Multiple Maps","authors":["Ehsan Amid","Antti Ukkonen"],"_abstract":"ABSTRACT For humans, it is usually easier to make statements about the similarity of objects in relative , rather than absolute terms. Moreover , subjective comparisons of objects can be based on a number of different and independent attributes. For example, objects can be compared based on their shape, color, etc. In this paper, we consider the problem of uncovering these hidden attributes given a set of relative distance judgments in the form of triplets. The attribute that was used to generate a particular triplet in this set is unknown. Such data occurs, e.g., in crowd-sourcing applications where the triplets are collected from a large group of workers. We propose the Multiview Triplet Embedding (MVTE) algorithm that produces a number of low-dimensional maps, each corresponding to one of the hidden attributes. The method can be used to assess how many different attributes were used to create the triplets, as well as to assess the difficulty of a distance comparison task, and find objects that have multiple interpretations in relation to the other objects.","cited_in":[],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320628_Generalized_Non-metric_Multidimensional_Scaling","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320432_Visualizing_Similarity_Data_with_a_Mixture_of_Maps","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243705404_Maximum_Likelihood_Estimation_of_Observer_Error-Rates_Using_the_EM_Algorithm","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220723764_The_Quest_for_Ground_Truth_in_Musical_Artist_Similarity","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262259924_The_Crowd-Median_Algorithm","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45460079_Conceptual_Distinctiveness_Supports_Detailed_Visual_Long-Term_Memory_for_Real-World_Objects","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24061680_Multidimensional_Scaling_by_Optimizing_Goodness_of_Fit_to_a_Non-Metric_Hypothesis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247931959_The_mnist_database_of_handwritten_digits","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276935841_Introduction_to_Information_Retrieval","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262242277_Eliminating_Spammers_and_Ranking_Annotators_for_Crowdsourced_Labeling_Tasks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320836_Think_Globally_Fit_Locally_Unsupervised_Learning_of_Low_Dimensional_Manifold","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51913048_Adaptively_Learning_the_Crowd_Kernel","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12204039_Langford_JC_A_Global_Geometric_Framework_for_Nonlinear_Dimensionality_Reduction_Science_290_2319-2323","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261392079_Stochastic_triplet_embedding","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221619723_Whose_Vote_Should_Count_More_Optimal_Integration_of_Labels_from_Labelers_of_Unknown_Expertise"]}
