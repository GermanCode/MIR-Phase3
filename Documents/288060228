{"id":288060228,"title":"Musical instrument sound classification with deep convolutional neural network using feature fusion approach","authors":["Taejin Park","Taejin Lee"],"_abstract":"ABSTRACT A new musical instrument classification method using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is presented in this paper. Unlike the traditional methods, we investigated a scheme for classifying musical instruments using the learned features from CNNs. To create the learned features from CNNs, we not only used a conventional spectrogram image, but also proposed multiresolution recurrence plots (MRPs) that contain the phase information of a raw input signal. Consequently, we fed the characteristic timbre of the particular instrument into a neural network, which cannot be extracted using a phase-blinded representations such as a spectrogram. By combining our proposed MRPs and spectrogram images with a multi-column network, the performance of our proposed classifier system improves over a system that uses only a spectrogram. Furthermore, the proposed classifier also outperforms the baseline result from traditional handcrafted features and classifiers.","cited_in":[],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239213712_AUTOMATIC_MUSICAL_INSTRUMENT_RECOGNITION","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3922216_Musical_instrument_timbres_classification_with_spectral_features","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224647611_Musical_instrument_classification_using_non-negative_matrix_factorization_algorithms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5503410_A_Study_on_Feature_Analysis_for_Musical_Instrument_Classification","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220655067_Musical_instrument_recognition_by_pairwise_classification_strategies","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2985446_Gradient-based_learning_applied_to_document_recognition_Proc_IEEE","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267960550_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264387213_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_for_Speech_Recognition","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221619818_Unsupervised_feature_learning_for_audio_classification_using_convolutional_deep_belief_networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269295564_End-to-end_learning_for_music_audio","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237145551_Estimating_Phoneme_Class_Conditional_Probabilities_from_Raw_Speech_Signal_using_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243752377_Recurrence_Plots_of_Dynamical_Systems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274733996_Extracting_Texture_Features_for_Time_Series_Classification","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7609009_Non-linear_analysis_of_EEG_signals_at_various_sleep_stages","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265414187_Psychophysics_An_Introduction_To_Its_Perceptual_Neural_And_Social_Prospects","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/20813767_Perceptual_Linear_Predictive_PLP_Analysis_of_Speech","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286594438_Large-Scale_Video_Classification_with_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221663833_Multi-column_Deep_Neural_Networks_for_Image_Classification","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221345737_Rectified_Linear_Units_Improve_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machines_Vinod_Nair","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236736851_Stochastic_Gradient_Learning_in_Neural_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286794765_Dropout_A_simple_way_to_prevent_neural_networks_from_overfitting","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4030978_Musical_instrument_recognition_using_ICA-based_transform_of_features_and_discriminatively_trained_HMMS","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224642063_Musical_Instrument_Classification_using_Non-Negative_Matrix_Factorization_Algorithms_and_Subset_Feature_Selection"]}
