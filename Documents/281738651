Law","Moneer Helu"],"_abstract":"Recent advances in machine automation and sensing technology offer new opportunities for continuous condition monitoring of an operating machine. This paper describes an intelligent machine monitoring framework that integrates and utilizes data collection, management, and analytics to derive an adaptive predictive model for the energy usage of a milling machine. This model is designed using a Gaussian Process (GP) regression algorithm, which is a flexible regression method that also provides an uncertainty estimate. To improve computational efficiency, we propose a Collective Gaussian Process (CGP) in which the overall energy prediction is made by constructing local GP models weighted by probability distribution functions obtained using the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) technique. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of the proposed monitoring framework to construct an energy prediction model to predict the energy used to machine a part.","cited_in":[{"id":286418563,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286418563_Real-Time_Energy_Prediction_for_a_Milling_Machine_Tool_Using_Sparse_Gaussian_Process_Regression"},{"id":284655236,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284655236_ENSEMBLE_NEURAL_NETWORK_MODEL_FOR_PREDICTING_THE_ENERGY_CONSUMPTION_OF_A_MILLING_MACHINE"},{"id":286418365,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286418365_A_generalized_data-driven_energy_prediction_model_with_uncertainty_for_a_milling_machine_tool_using_Gaussian_Process"},{"id":283720054,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283720054_A_Neural_Network_Meta-Model_and_its_Application_for_Manufacturing"}],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220286537_Hierarchical_Gaussian_Process_Mixtures_for_Regression","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263202236_Predictive_Analytics_Model_for_Power_Consumption_in_Manufacturing","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229702995_Fundamentals_Sensors_in_Mechanical_Manufacturing_-_Requirements_Demands_Boundary_Conditions_Signal_Processing_Communication_Techniques_and_Man-Machine_Interfaces","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12218265_A_Bayesian_Committee_Machine","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239666609_Bayesian_Learning_for_Neural_Networks_PhD_thesis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41781406_A_Unifying_View_of_Sparse_Approximate_Gaussian_Process_Regression","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222668694_Predicting_Surface_Roughness_in_Machining_a_Review","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223163422_Sensor_signals_for_tool-wear_monitoring_in_metal_cutting_operations_a_review_of_methods_Int_J_Mach_Tools_Manuf","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215721461_Maximum_Likelihood_From_Incomplete_Data_Via_The_EM_algorithm","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267974448_Strategies_for_Minimum_Energy_Operation_for_Precision_Machining","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239376259_Automated_energy_monitoring_of_machine_tools","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223024359_On-Line_and_Indirect_Tool_Wear_Monitoring_in_Turning_with_Artificial_Neural_Networks_a_Review_of_More_Than_a_Decade_of_Research_Mechanical_Systems_and_Signal_Processing_Vol_164_487-546","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222674333_Speaker_Verification_Using_Adapted_Gaussian_Mixture_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257069490_Gaussian_Processes_for_Big_Data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247598156_Sparse_Gaussian_Process_Using_Pseudo-inputs","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224167890_Online_Sparse_Gaussian_Process_Regression_and_Its_Applications","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41781559_Gaussian_Process_for_Machine_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284081148_Local_gaussian_process_regression_for_real_time_online_model_learning_and_control","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286226721_Lazy_Gaussian_process_committee_for_real-time_online_regression"]}
