{"id":258849829,"title":"A J‐function for Inhomogeneous Spatio‐temporal Point Processes","authors":["Ottmar Cronie","M. N. M. van Lieshout"],"_abstract":"We propose a new summary statistic for inhomogeneous intensity-reweighted moment stationary spatio-temporal point processes. The statistic is defined through the n-point correlation functions of the point process and it generalises the J-function when stationarity is assumed. We show that our statistic can be represented in terms of the generating functional and that it is related to the inhomogeneous K-function. We further discuss its explicit form under some specific model assumptions and derive a ratio-unbiased estimator. We finally illustrate the use of our statistic on simulated data.","cited_in":[{"id":263891581,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263891581_Summary_statistics_for_inhomogeneous_marked_point_processes"},{"id":260680357,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260680357_Spatio-temporal_cadlag_functional_marked_point_processes_Unifying_spatio-temporal_frameworks"},{"id":273709851,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273709851_Summary_statistics_for_inhomogeneous_marked_point_processes"}],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256198178_Random_Fields_and_Geometry","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2357909_Non-_and_Semi-Parametric_Estimation_of_Interaction_in_Inhomogeneous_Point_Patterns","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227616746_Spatiotemporal_prediction_for_log-Gaussian_Cox_processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222834730_Some_edge_correction_methods_for_marked_spatio-temporal_point_process_models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265505608_An_Introduction_to_the_Theory_of_Point_Processes_Volume_II_General_Theory_and_Structure","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23968354_Second-order_analysis_of_inhomogeneous_spatio-temporal_point_process_data_Statistica_Neerlandica_63143-51","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239845126_Markov_Point_Processes_and_Their_Applications","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225959139_A_J-Function_for_Marked_Point_Patterns","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232129036_A_nonparametric_measure_of_spatial_interaction_in_point_patterns","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227522879_Structured_Spatio-Temporal_Shot-Noise_Cox_Point_Process_Models_with_a_View_to_Modelling_Forest_Fires","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239730618_Aspects_of_second-order_analysis_of_structured_inhomogeneous_spatio-temporal_processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227701452_Log_Gaussian_Cox_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265716392_Statistical_Inference_and_Simulation_for_Spatial_Point_Process","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227635450_Modern_Statistics_for_Spatial_Point_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24052442_Space-Time_Point-Process_Models_for_Earthquake_Occurrences","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38361783_Positively_Correlated_Normal_Variables_Are_Associated","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265450418_Stochastic_an_Integral_Geometry","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5142877_SPATSTAT_an_R_package_for_analyzing_spatial_point_patterns","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232128993_Stochastic_Geometry_and_Its_Application","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265895837_Estimation_of_Poisson_Intensity_Using_Partially_Observed_Concomitant_Variables","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254809037_A_Remark_on_the_Van_Lieshout_and_Baddeley_J-Function_for_Point_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232128649_Spatial_Analysis_and_Modelling_of_Spatial_Point_Patterns","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/251562363_Correct_testing_of_mark_independence_for_marked_point_patterns","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/207265101_The_hierarchy_of_correlation_functions_and_its_relation_to_other_measures_of_galaxy_clustering","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45338524_On_Estimation_of_the_Intensity_Function_of_a_Point_Process","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256198631_The_Geometry_of_Random_Fields_New_York","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260680357_Spatio-temporal_cadlag_functional_marked_point_processes_Unifying_spatio-temporal_frameworks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268497854_An_Introduction_to_the_Theory_of_Point_Processes_Vol_I_Elementary_Theory_and_Methods","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233859454_A_lognormal_model_for_the_cosmological_mass_distribution","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263891581_Summary_statistics_for_inhomogeneous_marked_point_processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46581414_A_J-function_for_inhomogeneous_point_processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243963942_Global_envelope_tests_for_spatial_processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268641688_Handbook_of_Spatial_Statistics","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275973710_Measure_Theory","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266831723_Nonparametric_Analysis_of_Univariate_Heavy-Tailed_Data_Research_and_Practice","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287691228_stpp_An_R_Package_for_Plotting_Simulating_and_Analyzing_Spatio-Temporal_Point_Patterns"]}
