{"id":235709950,"title":"A Sequential Procedure for Selecting the Population with the Largest Mean from $k$ Normal Populations","authors":["Edward Paulson"],"_abstract":"ABSTRACT In this paper sequential procedures are given for selecting the normal population with the greatest mean when (a) the $k$ populations have a common known variance or (b) the $k$ populations have a common but unknown variance, so that in each case the probability of making the correct selection exceeds a specified value when the greatest mean exceeds all other means by at least a specified amount. The procedures in the present paper all have the property that inferior populations can be eliminated from further consideration as the experiment proceeds.","cited_in":[{"id":279633530,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279633530_Subsampling-Based_Approximate_Monte_Carlo_for_Discrete_Distributions"},{"id":259478458,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259478458_lil'_UCB_An_Optimal_Exploration_Algorithm_for_Multi-Armed_Bandits"},{"id":265830785,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265830785_Sequential_methods_for_comparative_effectiveness_experiments_Point_of_care_clinical_trials"},{"id":257196296,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257196296_Efficient_comparison_of_constrained_systems_using_dormancy"},{"id":257199330,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257199330_Step-up_and_step-down_methods_for_testing_multiple_hypotheses_in_sequential_experiments"},{"id":227936002,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227936002_Fully_Sequential_Procedures_for_Comparing_Constrained_Systems_via_Simulation"},{"id":220258688,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220258688_A_Knowledge-Gradient_Policy_for_Sequential_Information_Collection"},{"id":4249986,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4249986_The_Knowledge_Gradient_Policy_for_Offline_Learning_with_Independent_Normal_Rewards"},{"id":221528942,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221528942_Recent_advances_in_ranking_and_selection"},{"id":4213819,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4213819_Finding_the_best_in_the_presence_of_a_stochastic_constraint"},{"id":228649249,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228649249_The_tradeoff_between_sampling_and_switching_New_sequential_procedures_for_indifference-zone_selection"},{"id":222554257,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222554257_A_sequential_procedure_for_neighborhood_selection-of-the-best_in_optimization_via_simulation"},{"id":3933190,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3933190_Selection-of-the-best_procedures_for_optimization_via_simulation"},{"id":216301254,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/216301254_Comparing_systems_via_stochastic_simulation_Selection-of-the-best_procedures_for_optimization_via_simulation"},{"id":2471963,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2471963_A_Survey_Of_Ranking_Selection_And_Multiple_Comparison_Procedures_For_Discrete-Event_Simulation"},{"id":2510889,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2510889_Simple_Procedures_for_Selecting_the_Best_Simulated_System_when_the_Number_of_Alternatives_Is_Large"},{"id":2508196,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2508196_A_Fully_Sequential_Procedure_for_Indifference-Zone_Selection_in_Simulation"},{"id":232354825,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232354825_A_sequential_elimination_procedure_for_choosing_the_best_populations_based_on_multiple_testing"},{"id":254210211,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254210211_A_Sequential_Procedure_With_Finite_Memory_For_Some_Statistical_Problem"},{"id":32146266,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/32146266_Sequential_elimination_procedure_for_selecting_the_s_best_normal_populations_with_unknown_variance_Statistical_Inference_and_the_Bioequivalence_Problem"},{"id":46267534,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46267534_Advances_in_ranking_and_selection_variance_estimation_and_constraints"},{"id":228588888,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228588888_Sample_Design_for_Effective_Model_Building_and_Decision_Making"},{"id":235208945,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235208945_Proceedings_of_the_Twentieth_Conference_on_the_Design_of_Experiments_in_Army_Research_Development_and_Testing_Part_2_Ranking_and_Selection_Procedures"},{"id":267771705,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267771705_Simulation_ranking_and_selection_procedures_and_applications_in_network_reliability_design"},{"id":38365360,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38365360_Sequential_Procedures_for_Selecting_the_Best_One_of_Several_Binomial_Populations"},{"id":38365050,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38365050_The_Performance_of_Some_Sequential_Procedures_for_a_Ranking_Problem"},{"id":38364908,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38364908_An_Extension_of_Paulson's_Selection_Procedure"},{"id":225400714,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225400714_A_two-sample_procedure_for_selecting_the_population_with_the_largest_mean_fromk_normal_populations"},{"id":38364273,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38364273_A_Method_for_the_Construction_of_Sequential_Selection_Procedures"},{"id":243037125,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243037125_Some_sequential_procedures_for_ranking_multivariate_normal_populations"},{"id":241680754,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241680754_On_A_Sequential_Procedure_With_Finite_Memory_For_Testing_Statistical_Hypotheses"},{"id":243048757,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243048757_A_Two-stage_minimax_procedure_with_screenin
