{"id":279257828,"title":"Bandit Algorithms boost Brain Computer Interfaces for motor-task selection of a brain-controlled button","authors":["Joan Fruitet","Alexandra Carpentier","Remi Munos","Maureen Clerc"],"_abstract":"ABSTRACT Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) allow users to \"communicate\" with a computer without using their muscles. BCI based on sensori-motor rhythms use imaginary motor tasks, such as moving the right or left hand, to send control signals. The performances of a BCI can vary greatly across users but also depend on the tasks used, making the problem of appropriate task selection an important issue. This study presents a new procedure to automatically select as fast as possible a discriminant motor task for a brain-controlled button. We develop for this purpose an adaptive algorithm, UCB-classif, based on the stochastic bandit theory. This shortens the training stage, thereby allowing the exploration of a greater variety of tasks. By not wasting time on inefficient tasks, and focusing on the most promising ones, this algorithm results in a faster task selection and a more efficient use of the BCI training session. Comparing the proposed method to the standard practice in task selection, for a fixed time budget, UCB-classif leads to an improved classification rate, and for a fixed classification rate, to a reduction of the time spent in training by 50%.","cited_in":[{"id":261265056,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261265056_Emotional_influence_on_SSVEP_based_BCI"}],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277201928_Preliminary_study_for_an_offline_hybrid_BCI_using_sensorimotor_rhythms_and_beta_rebound","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/201976486_Some_Aspects_of_the_Sequential_Design_of_Experiments","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220343796_Finite-time_Analysis_of_the_Multiarmed_Bandit_Problem","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225888832_Electrocorticograms_in_man_Effect_of_voluntary_movement_on_the_electrical_activity_of_the_precentral_gyrus","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/43401204_OpenViBE_An_Open-Source_Software_Platform_to_Design_Test_and_Use_Brain-Computer_Interfaces_in_Real_and_Virtual_Environments","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221497549_Best_Arm_Identification_in_Multi-Armed_Bandits","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221345961_Exploration_scavenging","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6353726_The_non-invasive_Berlin_Brain-Computer_Interface_Fast_acquisition_of_effective_performance_in_untrained_subjects","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222568717_Analysis_of_sensorimotor_rhythms_for_the_implementation_of_a_brain_switch_for_healthy_subjects","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2360567_Hoeffding_Races_Accelerating_Model_Selection_Search_for_Classification_and_Function_Approximation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13760548_Neuper_C_Motor_imagery_activates_primary_sensorimotor_area_in_humans_Neurosci_Lett_239_65-68","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234822726_Automatic_motor_task_selection_via_a_bandit_algorithm_for_a_brain-controlled_button","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/40039873_Towards_a_cure_for_BCI_illiteracy_Brain_Topogr","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12723731_Event-related_EEGMEG_synchronization_and_desynchronization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278651717_The_Nature_of_Statistical_Learning_Theory","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12127239_Optimal_Spatial_Filtering_of_Single_Trial_EEG_During_Imagined_Hand_Movement","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41028518_A_comparison_of_regression_techniques_for_a_two-dimensional_sensorimotor_rhythm-based_brain-computer_interface","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224097141_The_selection_of_proper_discriminative_cognitive_tasks_-_A_necessary_prerequisite_in_high-quality_BCI_applications","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224203597_Spectral_EEG_features_and_tasks_selection_process_Some_considerations_toward_BCI_applications","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/44590408_Electroencephalographic_EEG_control_of_three-dimensional_movement_J_Neural_Eng_7036007","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222522631_Brain-Actuated_Interaction"]}
