{"id":259483032,"title":"Monte Carlo Non-Local Means: Random Sampling for Large-Scale Image Filtering","authors":["Stanley H. Chan","Todd Zickler","Yue M. Lu"],"_abstract":"ABSTRACT We propose a randomized version of the non-local means (NLM) algorithm for large-scale image filtering. The new algorithm, called Monte Carlo non-local means (MCNLM), speeds up the classical NLM by computing a small subset of image patch distances, which are randomly selected according to a designed sampling pattern. We make two contributions. First, we analyze the performance of the MCNLM algorithm and show that, for large images or large external image databases, the random outcomes of MCNLM are tightly concentrated around the deterministic full NLM result. In particular, our error probability bounds show that, at any given sampling ratio, the probability for MCNLM to have a large deviation from the original NLM solution decays exponentially as the size of the image or database grows. Second, we derive explicit formulas for optimal sampling patterns that minimize the error probability bound by exploiting partial knowledge of the pairwise similarity weights. Numerical experiments show that MCNLM is competitive with other state-of-the-art fast NLM algorithms for single-image denoising. When applied to denoising images using an external database containing ten billion patches, MCNLM returns a randomized solution that is within 0.2 dB of the full NLM solution while reducing the runtime by three orders of magnitude.","cited_in":[{"id":267099830,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267099830_Relevant_sampling_in_finitely_generated_shift-invariant_spaces"},{"id":264123226,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264123226_Adaptive_Image_Denoising_by_Targeted_Databases"},{"id":259483032,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259483032_Monte_Carlo_Non-Local_Means_Random_Sampling_for_Large-Scale_Image_Filtering"},{"id":279517599,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279517599_Comments_on_Randomly_Sampled_Non_Local_Means_Image_Filter"},{"id":269295535,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269295535_Image_denoising_by_targeted_external_databases"},{"id":263967838,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263967838_Sparse_Reconstruction_of_Depth_Data_Representation_Algorithm_and_Sampling"},{"id":273463072,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273463072_Depth_Reconstruction_From_Sparse_Samples_Representation_Algorithm_and_Sampling"},{"id":282951796,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282951796_Noise_suppression_algorithm_for_chaotic_mapping_based_on_nonlocal_mean"},{"id":269726083,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269726083_Non-Local_Means_Image_Denoising_With_a_Soft_Threshold"},{"id":280949280,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280949280_Denoising_Stimulated_Raman_Spectroscopic_Images_by_Total_Variation_Minimization"},{"id":282837184,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282837184_Integral_non-local_means_algorithm_for_image_noise_suppression"},{"id":283467431,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283467431_RHFMs_similarity_based_nonlocal_means_image_denoising_in_PDTDFB_domain"}],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224091804_Fast_Non-Local_Means_NLM_Computation_With_Probabilistic_Early_Termination","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5268594_Efficient_Nonlocal_Means_for_Denoising_of_Textural_Patterns","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221624387_Fast_nonlocal_filtering_applied_to_electron_cryomicroscopy","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224182481_Camera_Culture_Building_and_Using_a_Database_of_One_Trillion_Natural-_Image_Patches","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224115041_Fast_Non-Local_algorithm_for_image_denoising","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221110774_Non-local_sparse_models_for_image_restoration_In_ICCV","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261015585_Global_Image_Denoising","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23960272_Principal_components_for_non-local_means_image_denoising","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6151802_Image_Denoising_by_Sparse_3-D_Transform-Domain_Collaborative_Filtering","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6773289_Optimal_Spatial_Adaptation_for_Patch-Based_Image_Denoising","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38357750_Probability_Inequalities_for_the_Sum_in_Sampling_without_Replacement","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/37992037_LabelMe_A_Database_and_Web-Based_Tool_for_Image_Annotation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233531979_Non-Local_Patch_Regression_Robust_Image_Denoising_in_Patch_Space","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4215294_Denoising_image_sequences_does_not_require_motion_estimation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6451933_Fast_Non_Local_Means_Denoising_for_3D_MR_Images","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261501975_Fast_non-local_filtering_by_random_sampling_It_works_especially_for_large_images","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224254723_Natural_image_denoising_Optimality_and_inherent_bounds","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233995491_Nonlocally_Centralized_Sparse_Representation_for_Image_Restoration","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224223530_Non-Local_Means_With_Dimensionality_Reduction_and_SURE-Based_Parameter_Selection","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224057598_Fast_Non-Local_Algorithm_for_Image_Denoising","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262252173_Patch_Complexity_Finite_Pixel_Correlations_and_Optimal_Denoising","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23676478_Generalizing_the_Nonlocal-Means_to_Super-Resolution_Reconstruction","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221122164_Efficient_nonlocal-means_denoising_using_the_SVD","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220183755_Gaussian_KD-Trees_for_Fast_High-Dimensional_Filtering","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224562845_SURE-based_non-local_means","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258635349_Novel_Speed-Up_Strategies_for_Non-Local_Means_Denoising_With_Patch_and_Edge_Patch_Based_Dictionaries","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/37995685_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220617443_Fast_Monte_Carlo_Algorithms_for_Matrices_I_Approximating_Matrix_Multiplication","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41107019_A_Review_of_Image_Denoising_Algorithms_with_a_New_One"
