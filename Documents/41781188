Sch√∂lkopf"],"_abstract":"ABSTRACT We generalise the Gaussian process (GP) framework for regression by learning a nonlinear transformation of the GP outputs. This allows for non-Gaussian processes and non-Gaussian noise. The learning algorithm chooses a nonlinear transformation such that transformed data is well-modelled by a GP. This can be seen as including a preprocessing transformation as an integral part of the probabilistic modelling problem, rather than as an ad-hoc step. We demonstrate on several real regression problems that learning the transformation can lead to significantly better performance than using a regular GP, or a GP with a fixed transformation.","cited_in":[{"id":284476380,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284476380_Variational_Auto-encoded_Deep_Gaussian_Processes"},{"id":262256567,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262256567_Gait-based_age_estimation_using_a_whole-generation_gait_database"},{"id":45924756,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45924756_Heavy-Tailed_Processes_for_Selective_Shrinkage"},{"id":221618564,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221618564_Heavy-Tailed_Process_Priors_for_Selective_Shrinkage"},{"id":224461344,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224461344_Nonparametric_curve_alignment"},{"id":257807039,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257807039_Testing_the_Gauss_linear_assumption_for_on-line_predictions"},{"id":41371118,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41371118_Implementation_of_gaussian_process_models_for_non-linear_system_identification"},{"id":266569991,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266569991_Copulae_in_mathematical_and_quantitative_finance_Proceedings_of_the_workshop_Cracow_Poland_July_10-11_2012"},{"id":220320873,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320873_Gaussian_Processes_for_Ordinal_Regression"},{"id":269298875,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269298875_Predictive_Uncertainty_in_Environmental_Modelling"},{"id":269298963,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269298963_Predictive_Uncertainty_in_Environmental_Modelling"},{"id":258903887,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258903887_Implementation_of_Gaussian_Process_models_for_nonlinear_system_identification"},{"id":221618302,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221618302_Robust_Regression_with_Twinned_Gaussian_Processes"},{"id":6305207,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6305207_Predictive_uncertainty_in_environmental_modeling"},{"id":221618852,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221618852_Accelerating_Bayesian_Inference_over_Nonlinear_Differential_Equations_with_Gaussian_Processes"},{"id":221345111,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221345111_Function_factorization_using_warped_Gaussian_processes"},{"id":221362463,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221362463_Multi-Task_Warped_Gaussian_Process_for_Personalized_Age_Estimation"},{"id":221619788,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221619788_Implicitly_Constrained_Gaussian_Process_Regression_for_Monocular_Non-Rigid_Pose_Estimation"},{"id":45922205,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45922205_Copula_Processes"},{"id":51227301,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51227301_Bayesian_analysis_of_non-linear_differential_equation_models_with_application_to_a_gut_microbial_ecosystem"},{"id":254044513,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254044513_Gaussian_Process_Gauss-Newton_Non-Parametric_State_Estimation"},{"id":239763356,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239763356_On_hyperbolic_sine_activation_functions_used_in_ZNN_for_time-varying_matrix_square_roots_finding"},{"id":233827967,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233827967_No-reference_image_quality_assessment_through_the_von_Mises_distribution"},{"id":267440775,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267440775_Copulas_in_Machine_Learning"},{"id":261416279,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261416279_Adaptive_sensing_of_time_series_with_application_to_remote_exploration"},{"id":260637079,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260637079_Gaussian_Processes_for_Nonlinear_Signal_Processing_An_Overview_of_Recent_Advances"},{"id":261418423,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261418423_Bounded_Gaussian_process_regression"},{"id":259204294,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259204294_Statistical_modelling_of_networked_human-automation_performance_using_working_memory_capacity"},{"id":262254938,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262254938_On_Estimation_of_Functional_Causal_Models_Post-Nonlinear_Causal_Model_as_an_Example"},{"id":267337683,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267337683_Modelling_Transcriptional_Regulation_with_Gaussian_Processes"},{"id":260379261,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260379261_Impact_of_Oophorectomy_on_Cancer_Incidence_and_Mortality_in_Women_With_a_BRCA1_or_BRCA2_Mutation"},{"id":261046761,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261046761_Recursive_Gaussian_Process_On-line_Regression_and_Learning"},{"id":260799197,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260799197_Statistical_Parametric_Speech_Synthesis_Based_on_Gaussian_Process_Regression"},{"id":262068425,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262068425_Improved_global-best_particle_swarm_optimization_algorithm_with_mixed-attribute_data_classification_capability"},{"id":262805792,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262805792_Transductive_Learning_for_Multi-Task_Copula_Processes"
