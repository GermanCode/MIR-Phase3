{"id":229088276,"title":"Exact Sampling and Decoding in High-Order Hidden Markov Models","authors":["Simon Carter","Marc Dymetman","Guillaume Bouchard"],"_abstract":"ABSTRACT We present a method for exact optimization and sampling from high order Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), which are generally handled by approximation techniques. Motivated by adaptive rejection sampling and heuristic search, we propose a strategy based on sequentially refining a lower-order language model that is an upper bound on the true model we wish to decode and sample from. This allows us to build tractable variable-order HMMs. The ARPA format for language models is extended to enable an efficient use of the max-backoff quantities required to compute the upper bound. We evaluate our approach on two problems: a SMS-retrieval task and a POS tagging experiment using 5-gram models. Results show that the same approach can be used for exact optimization and sampling, while explicitly constructing only a fraction of the total implicit state-space.","cited_in":[{"id":228103017,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228103017_The_OS_Algorithm_a_Joint_Approach_to_Exact_Optimization_and_Sampling"}],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2538294_TnT_A_Statistical_Part-of-Speech_Tagger","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/32896369_Hierarchical_Dirichlet_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221345210_Beam_sampling_for_the_infinite_hidden_Markov_model","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221012856_Solving_the_Problem_of_Cascading_Errors_Approximate_Bayesian_Inference_for_Linguistic_Annotation_Pipelines","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3192590_Document_image_decoding_by_heuristic_search","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220873154_A_Hierarchical_Bayesian_Language_Model_Based_On_Pitman-Yor_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221012920_On_Dual_Decomposition_and_Linear_Programming_Relaxations_for_Natural_Language_Processing","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220017637_Building_a_Large_Annotated_Corpus_of_English_The_Penn_Treebank","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221013080_Exact_Decoding_of_Phrase-Based_Translation_Models_through_Lagrangian_Relaxation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228379274_Europarl_A_parallel_corpus_for_statistical_machine_translation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2929141_Minimum_Bayes-Risk_Decoding_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2602251_Srilm_---_An_Extensible_Language_Modeling_Toolkit","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233193155_Concave-Convex_Adaptive_Rejection_Sampling","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215991237_Exact_Decoding_of_Syntactic_Translation_Models_through_Lagrangian_Relaxation"]}
