{"id":280908562,"title":"What Engineering Technology Could Do for Quality of Life in Parkinson's Disease: A Review of Current Needs and Opportunities","authors":["Jonathan A. Stamford","Peter Schmidt","Karl Friedl"],"_abstract":"ABSTRACT Parkinson's Disease (PD) involves well known motor symptoms such as tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and altered gait but there are also non-locomotory motor symptoms (e.g., changes in handwriting and speech) and even non-motor symptoms (e.g., disrupted sleep, depression) that can be measured, monitored, and possibly better managed through activity based monitoring technologies. This will enhance quality of life (QoL) in PD through improved self-monitoring, and also provide information which could be shared with a health care provider to help better manage treatment. Until recently, non-motor symptoms (\"soft signs\") had been generally overlooked in clinical management yet these are of primary importance to patients and their QoL. Day-to-day variability of the condition, the high variability in symptoms between patients, and the isolated snapshots of a patient in periodic clinic visits makes better monitoring essential to the proper management of PD. Continuously monitored patterns of activity, social interactions, and daily activities could provide a rich source of information on status changes, guiding self correction and clinical management. The same tools can be useful in earlier detection of PD and will improve clinical studies. Remote medical communications in the form of telemedicine, sophisticated tracking of medication use, and assistive technologies that directly compensate for disease related challenges are examples of other near term technology solutions to PD problems. Ultimately, a sensor technology is no good if it is not used. The Parkinson's community is a sophisticated early adopter of useful technologies and a group for which engineers can provide near term gratifying benefits.","cited_in":[],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226307312_Verteilung_Von_Noradrenalin_Und_Dopamin_3-Hydroxytyramin_Im_Gehirn_Des_Menschen_Und_Ihr_Verhalten_Bei_Erkrankungen_Des_Extrapyramidalen_Systems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/18986414_Modification_of_Parkinsonism-chronic_treatment_with_L-DOPA","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259206799_Treatment_of_Parkinson's_Disease_What's_in_the_Non-dopaminergic_Pipeline","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7802359_Anhedonia_Depression_and_Motor_Functioning_in_Parkinson's_Disease_During_Treatment_With_Pramipexole","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249320858_Innovations_in_e-health","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7289529_AHV_National_Institute_for_Clinical_Excellence_Non-motor_symptoms_of_Parkinson's_disease_diagnosis_and_management","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/49783573_The_Impact_of_Non-Motor_Symptoms_on_Health-Related_Quality_of_Life_of_Patients_with_Parkinson's_Disease","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51479498_Parkinson's_disease_The_non-motor_issues","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13666198_PDQ-39_A_review_of_the_development_validation_and_application_of_a_Parkinson's_Disease_quality_of_life_questionnaire_and_its_associated_measures","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229009022_What_are_the_issues_facing_Parkinson's_disease_patients_at_ten_years_of_disease_and_beyond_Data_from_the_NPF-QII_study","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264056396_Recognition_and_Treatment_of_Depressive_Symptoms_in_Parkinson's_Disease_The_NPF_Dataset","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/20787339_Compliance_Declines_between_Clinic_Visits","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/14858609_Interactive_video_conferencing_A_means_of_providing_interim_care_to_Parkinson's_disease_patients","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232719313_Potential_reliability_and_validity_of_a_modified_version_of_the_Unified_Parkinson's_Disease_Rating_Scale_that_could_be_administered_remotely","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272883397_Improving_patient_participation_in_Parkinson's_clinical_trials_the_experience_of_the_Michael_J_Fox_Foundation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259491542_A_Noninvasive_Handheld_Assistive_Device_to_Accommodate_Essential_Tremor_A_Pilot_Study","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256836321_Medication_Reminder_Service_for_Mobile_Phones_An_Open_Feasibility_Study_in_Patients_with_Parkinson's_Disease","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235387732_Detecting_Parkinsons'_symptoms_in_uncontrolled_home_environments_A_multiple_instance_learning_approach","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257750158_Nonmotor_Symptoms_in_Nursing_Home_Residents_with_Parkinson's_Disease_Prevalence_and_Effect_on_Quality_of_Life","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227629562_What_Are_the_Most_Important_Nonmotor_Symptoms_in_Patients_with_Parkinson's_Disease_and_Are_We_Missing_Them","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256541549_Quantitative_Wearable_Sensors_for_Objective_Assessment_of_Parkinson's_Disease","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224809210_A_Review_of_Wearable_Sensors_and_Systems_with_Application_in_Rehabilitation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/48324366_Design_and_baseline_characteristics_of_the_ParkFit_study_a_randomized_controlled_trial_evaluating_the_effectiveness_of_a_multifaceted_behavioral_program_to_increase_physical_activity_in_Parkinson_pati","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256098954_Evaluation_of_implementation_of_the_Park_Fit_program_A_multifaceted_intervention_aimed_to_promote_physical_activity_in_patients_with_Parkinson's_disease","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224971379_Capturing_Ambulatory_Activity_Decline_in_Parkinson's_Disease","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273504422_Physical_activity_and_sedentary_behavior_patterns_using_accelerometry_from_a_national_sample_of_United_States_adults","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/10756864_The_role_of_actigraphy_in_the_study_of_sleep_and_circadian_rhythms_American_Academy_of_Sleep_Medicine_Review_Paper","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12344728_Sleep_estimation_from_wrist_activity_in_patients_with_major_depression","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262646272_Technologically_sensed_social_exposure_related_to_slow-wave_sleep_in_healthy_adults","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221758039_A_method_for_classification_of_movements_in_bed","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236637706_Subjectively_impaired_bed_mobility_in_Parkinson_disease_affects_sleep_efficiency","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260251725_Leg_actigraphy_to_quantify_periodic_limb_movements_of_sleep_A_systematic_review_and_meta-analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5262674_Fatigue_in_Parkinson's_disease_is_not_associated_with_reduced_physical_activity","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/1130457
