{"id":276923083,"title":"Sequential Bayesian inference for implicit hidden Markov models and current limitations","authors":["Pierre E Jacob"],"_abstract":"Hidden Markov models can describe time series arising in various fields of science, by treating the data as noisy measurements of an arbitrarily complex Markov process. Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods have become standard tools to estimate the hidden Markov process given the observations and a fixed parameter value. We review some of the recent developments allowing the inclusion of parameter uncertainty as well as model uncertainty. The shortcomings of the currently available methodology are emphasised from an algorithmic complexity perspective. The statistical objects of interest for time series analysis are illustrated on a toy \"Lotka-Volterra\" model used in population ecology. Some open challenges are discussed regarding the scalability of the reviewed methodology to longer time series, higher-dimensional state spaces and more flexible models.","cited_in":[],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225464292_Using_stochastic_volatility_models_to_analyse_weekly_ozone_averages_in_Mexico_City","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261952439_Establishing_some_order_amongst_exact_approximations_of_MCMCs","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/231609430_Convergence_properties_of_pseudo-marginal_Markov_chain_Monte_Carloalgorithms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4217606_On-Line_Parameter_Estimation_in_General_State-Space_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227522317_Particle_Markov_Chain_Monte_Carlo","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259441094_Uniform_Ergodicity_of_the_Iterated_Conditional_SMC_and_Geometric_Ergodicity_of_Particle_Gibbs_samplers","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5218127_Econometric_Analysis_of_Realised_Volatility_and_Its_Use_in_Estimating_Stochastic_Volatility_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5110883_On_the_computational_complexity_of_MCMC-based_estimators_in_large_samples","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230693177_The_origins_and_evolution_of_predator-prey_theory","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262805663_Adaptively_Blocked_Particle_Filtering_with_Spatial_Smoothing_in_Large-Scale_Dynamic_Random_Fields","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/50425579_On_the_Stability_of_Sequential_Monte_Carlo_Methods_in_High_Dimensions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269417068_A_Stable_Particle_Filter_in_High-Dimensions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3319314_Resampling_algorithms_and_architectures_for_distributed_particle_filters","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/1909272_Time_series_analysis_via_mechanistic_models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236853542_Inference_in_Hidden_Markov_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243764505_Bayesian_Model_Choice_via_Markov_Chain_Monte_Carlo","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3320596_Bayesian_Inference_for_Linear_Dynamic_Models_With_Dirichlet_Process_Mixtures","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2923975_An_Improved_Particle_Filter_for_Non-linear_Problems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228665417_A_nonasymptotic_theorem_for_unnormalized_Feynman-Kac_particle_models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265687011_Theory_of_Parallel_Particle_Filters_for_Hidden_Markov_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2453431_A_Sequential_Particle_Filter_Method_for_Static_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2121967_Central_Limit_Theorem_for_sequential_Monte_Carlo_methods_and_its_application_to_Bayesian_inference","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45880515_Stability_of_Feynman-Kac_formulae_with_path-dependent_potentials","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/48182441_SMC2_An_efficient_algorithm_for_sequential_analysis_of_state_space_models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255704658_Nested_particle_filters_for_online_parameter_estimation_in_discrete-time_state-space_Markov_models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242502401_Statistical_theory-The_prequential_approach","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/50855792_Parameter_Estimation_for_Hidden_Markov_Models_with_IntractableLikelihoods","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228905584_On_a_Class_of_Genealogical_and_Interacting_Metropolis_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/29601804_Particle_methods_An_introduction_with_applications","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4993330_Sequential_Monte_Carlo_Samplers","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221668291_On_adaptive_resampling_strategies_for_sequential_Monte_Carlo_methods","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221664028_Sequential_Monte_Carlo_smoothing_for_general_state_space_hidden_Markovmodels","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228623464_A_Tutorial_on_Particle_Filtering_and_Smoothing_Fifteen_Years_Later","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200744518_Sequential_Monte-Carlo_Methods_in_Practice","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255644062_Sequential_Monte_Carlo_Computation_of_the_Score_and_Observed_Information_Matrix_in_State-Space_Models_with_Application_to_Parameter_Estimation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232062873_Efficient_implementation_of_Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo_when_using_an_unbiased_likelihood_estimator","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239285791_Markov_Chain_Monte_Carlo_Sufficient_Statistics_and_Particle_Filters","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221344933_An_HDP-HMM_for_systems_with_state_persistence","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230610067_Bridging_the_ensemble_Kalman_and_particle_filter","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237145783_Bayesian_Inference_and_Learning_in_Gaussian_Process_State-Space_Models_with_Particle_MCMC","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228204581_Efficient_Learning_via_Simulation_A_Marginalized_Resample-Move_Approach","https://www.researchgate.ne
