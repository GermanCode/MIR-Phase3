{"id":263965917,"title":"A Survey on Visual Human Action Recognition","authors":["Qiong Hu","Lei Qin","Qingming Huang"],"_abstract":"Visual Human Action Recognition is a universal hot topic of image processing, computer vision, pattern recognition, machine learning and artificial intelligence with wide application in video surveillance, human-computer interaction, virtual reality, content based video retrieval, video coding, etc. In this paper, we analyze the state-of-the-arts and advances of this field from perspectives of feature extraction, action recognition and benchmark datasets and competitions. In addition, the problems, difficulties, challenges and valuable future directions of human action recognition are presented.","cited_in":[{"id":282174321,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282174321_Intelligent_visual_surveillance_A_review"}],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223756107_Actor-independent_action_search_using_spatiotemporal_vocabulary_with_appearance_hashing","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257671988_Stochastic_Representation_and_Recognition_of_High-Level_Group_Activities","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257334067_Recognizing_50_human_action_categories_of_web_videos","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224181526_PETS2010_and_PETS2009_Evaluation_of_Results_Using_Individual_Ground_Truthed_Single_Views","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221362949_Learning_3D_action_models_from_a_few_2D_videos_for_view_invariant_action_recognition","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/49716950_An_Extended_Grammar_System_for_Learning_and_Recognizing_Complex_Visual_Events","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221304716_Recognizing_and_Tracking_Human_Action","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221111225_Automatic_construction_of_an_action_video_shot_database_using_web_videos","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221364410_Action_recognition_with_multiscale_spatio-temporal_contexts","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220928373_Group_Activity_Recognition_by_Gaussian_Processes_Estimation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285784185_Pair-wise_event_detection_in_surveillance_video","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260353896_Infinite_Hidden_Conditional_Random_Fields_for_Human_Behavior_Analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220660110_Human_Action_Segmentation_and_Recognition_Using_Discriminative_Semi-Markov_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/290583350_Some_advances_in_human_motion_analysis"]}
