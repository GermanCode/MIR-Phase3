{"id":256762204,"title":"Bayesian Degree-Corrected Stochastic Block Models for Community Detection","authors":["Lijun Peng","Luis E Carvalho"],"_abstract":"ABSTRACT Community detection in networks has drawn much attention in diverse fields, especially social sciences. Given its significance, there has been a large body of literature among which many are not statistically based. In this paper, we propose a novel stochastic blockmodel based on a logistic regression setup with node correction terms to better address this problem. We follow a Bayesian approach that explicitly captures the community behavior via prior specification. We then adopt a data augmentation strategy with latent Polya-Gamma variables to obtain posterior samples. We conduct inference based on a canonically mapped centroid estimator that formally addresses label non-identifiability. We demonstrate the novel proposed model and estimation on real-world as well as simulated benchmark networks and show that the proposed model and estimator are more flexible, representative, and yield smaller error rates when compared to the MAP estimator from classical degree-corrected stochastic blockmodels.","cited_in":[],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241251898_An_Improved_Criterion_for_Clustering_Based_on_the_Posterior_Similarity_Matrix","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/44851701_Mining_metabolic_pathways_through_gene_expression","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7659762_Finding_and_Evaluating_Community_Structure_in_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220182914_Geman_D_Stochastic_relaxation_Gibbs_distribution_and_the_Bayesian_restoration_of_images_IEEE_Trans_Pattern_Anal_Mach_Intell_PAMI-66_721-741","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222468369_Building_stochastic_blockmodels","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/30013070_On_Finding_Graph_Clusterings_with_Maximum_Modularity","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2321640_Dealing_With_Label-Switching_in_Mixture_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/31002185_Bayesian_Cluster_Analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2515569_Optimal_Predictive_Model_Selection","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221405088_Modeling_Social_Networks_with_Node_Attributes_using_the_Multiplicative_Attribute_Graph_Model","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227334923_Estimation_and_Prediction_for_Stochastic_Blockmodels_for_Graphs_with_Latent_Block_Structure","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7060226_Newman_MEJ_Modularity_and_community_structure_in_networks_Proc_Natl_Acad_Sci_USA_103_8577-8582","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8463952_Fast_algorithm_for_detecting_community_structure_in_networks_Phys_Rev_E_Stat_Nonlin_Soft_Matter_Phys_696_Pt_2_066133","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/35598307_A_novitiate_in_a_period_of_change_microform_an_experimental_and_case_study_of_social_relationships","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224434544_Some_Distance_Properties_of_Latent_Root_and_Vector_Methods_Used_in_Multivariate_Analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239356602_A_tutorial_on_the_SWEEP_operator","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2467456_Estimation_and_prediction_for_stochasticblockstructures_J_Am_Stat_Assoc","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23464007_Benchmark_graphs_for_testing_community_detection_algorithms_Phys_Rev_E78_046110","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4744648_Latent_Space_Approaches_to_Social_Network_Analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226890294_Community_Discovery_in_Social_Networks_Applications_Methods_and_Emerging_Trends","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6609402_Resolution_limit_in_community_detection_Proc_Nat_Acad_Sci_USA","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254286336_Statistical_Analysis_of_Multiple_Sociometric_Relations","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233950933_On_the_Statistical-Analysis_of_Dirty_Pictures","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4741891_Bilinear_Mixed-Effects_Models_for_Dyadic_Data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5547632_Centroid_estimation_in_discrete_high-dimensional_spaces_with_application_in_biology","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51417734_A_Bayesian_Approach_to_Network_Modularity","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228766359_The_Political_Blogosphere_and_the_2004_US_Election_Divided_They_Blog","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227621291_Model-Based_Clustering_for_Social_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243768137_An_Exponential_Family_of_Probability_Distributions_for_Directed_Graphs","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221995881_Bayesian_Data_Analysis_London","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228672773_Bayesian_Model-Based_Clustering_Procedures","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/1892381_Mixed_membership_stochastic_blockmodels_arXiv","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45928502_Spectral_clustering_and_the_high-dimensional_stochastic_blockmodel","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/251738965_An_Algorithm_for_Partitioning_the_Nodes_of_a_Graph","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/31223587_Approximations_to_Bayesian_Clustering_Rules","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239939571_Testing_and_Modeling_Dependencies_Between_a_Network_and_Nodal_Attributes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/201976941_An_Efficient_Heuristic_Procedure_for_Partitioning_Graphs","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247650053_Stochastic_Blockmodels_for_Directed_Graphs","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/50397804_Stochastic_blockmodels_and_community_structure_in_networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248519014_An_Information_Flow_Model_for_Conflict_and_Fission_in_Small_Groups1","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237005291_Community_identification_using_Extremal_Optimization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234779006_Lower_Bounds_for_the_Partitioning_of_Graphs","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233538736_'An_Introduction_to_Exponential_Random_Graph_P_Models_for_Social_Networks'","https://www.researchga
