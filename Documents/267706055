{"id":267706055,"title":"Practical Variational Inference for Neural Networks","authors":["Alex Graves"],"_abstract":"Variational methods have been previously explored as a tractable approximation to Bayesian inference for neural networks. However the approaches proposed so far have only been applicable to a few simple network architectures. This paper introduces an easy-to-implement stochastic variational method (or equivalently, minimum description length loss function) that can be applied to most neural net-works. Along the way it revisits several common regularisers from a variational perspective. It also provides a simple pruning heuristic that can both drastically re-duce the number of network weights and lead to improved generalisation. Exper-imental results are provided for a hierarchical multidimensional recurrent neural network applied to the TIMIT speech corpus.","cited_in":[{"id":281768642,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281768642_Hessian-Free_Optimization_For_Learning_Deep_Multidimensional_Recurrent_Neural_Networks"},{"id":277959252,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277959252_Bayesian_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_with_Bernoulli_Approximate_Variational_Inference"},{"id":228095632,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228095632_Variational_Bayesian_Inference_with_Stochastic_Search"},{"id":261309981,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261309981_Hybrid_speech_recognition_with_Deep_Bidirectional_LSTM"},{"id":258818168,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258818168_Speech_Recognition_with_Deep_Recurrent_Neural_Networks"},{"id":258818407,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258818407_Expectation_Propagation_for_Neural_Networks_with_Sparsity-Promoting_Priors"},{"id":258201479,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258201479_Deep_AutoRegressive_Networks"},{"id":262991675,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262991675_Stochastic_Backpropagation_and_Approximate_Inference_in_Deep_Generative_Models"},{"id":269932513,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269932513_The_MERLMELCOTUM_system_for_the_REVERB_challenge_using_deep_recurrent_neural_network_feature_enhancement"},{"id":269932714,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269932714_Dual_System_Combination_Approach_for_Various_Reverberant_Environments_with_Dereverberation"},{"id":262030045,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262030045_Deep_Learning_in_Neural_Networks_An_Overview"},{"id":282005595,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282005595_Expectation_Backpropagation_Parameter-Free_Training_of_Multilayer_Neural_Networks_with_Continuous_or_Discrete_Weights"},{"id":277959098,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277959098_Dropout_as_a_Bayesian_Approximation_Representing_Model_Uncertainty_in_Deep_Learning"},{"id":277959103,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277959103_Dropout_as_a_Bayesian_Approximation_Appendix"}],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2280218_Keeping_Neural_Networks_Simple_by_Minimizing_the_Description_Length_of_the_Weights","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3593275_Pruning_recurrent_neural_networks_for_improved_generalization_performance","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265368057_MacKay_DJC_Probable_networks_and_plausible_predictions_-_a_review_of_practical_Bayesian_methods_for_supervised_neural_networks_Network_Computation_in_Neural_Systems_6_469-505","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3175691_Speaker-independent_phone_recognition_using_hidden_Markov_models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222812561_Modeling_By_Shortest_Data_Description","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221620610_Offline_Arabic_Handwriting_Recognition_with_Multidimensional_Recurrent_Neural_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220499717_Simplifying_Neural_Networks_by_Soft_Weight-Sharing","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3568712_A_Direct_Adaptive_Method_for_Faster_Backpropagation_Learning_The_RPROP_Algorithm","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221346365_Connectionist_temporal_classification_Labelling_unsegmented_sequence_data_with_recurrent_neural_'networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3303419_Variational_Learning_and_Bits-Back_Coding_An_Information-Theoretic_View_to_Bayesian_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220905856_Classification_by_Minimum-Message-Length_Inference","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23252767_The_Variational_Gaussian_Approximation_Revisited","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3302208_An_analysis_of_noise_in_recurrent_neural_networks_Convergence_and_generalization"]}
