{"id":288022028,"title":"Applying deep neural networks to HEP job classification","authors":["L Wang","J Shi","X Yan"],"_abstract":"ABSTRACT The cluster of IHEP computing center is a middle-sized computing system which provides 10 thousands CPU cores, 5 PB disk storage, and 40 GB/s IO throughput. Its 1000+ users come from a variety of HEP experiments. In such a system, job classification is an indispensable task. Although experienced administrator can classify a HEP job by its IO pattern, it is unpractical to classify millions of jobs manually. We present how to solve this problem with deep neural networks in a supervised learning way. Firstly, we built a training data set of 320K samples by an IO pattern collection agent and a semi-automatic process of sample labelling. Then we implemented and trained DNNs models with Torch. During the process of model training, several meta-parameters was tuned with cross-validations. Test results show that a 5- hidden-layer DNNs model achieves 96% precision on the classification task. By comparison, it outperforms a linear model by 8% precision.","cited_in":[],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6912170_Reducing_the_Dimensionality_of_Data_with_Neural_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234131319_Efficient_Estimation_of_Word_Representations_in_Vector_Space","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267960550_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255564385_Large_Vocabulary_Speech_Recognition_Using_Deep_Tensor_Neural_Networks","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263704884_Searching_for_Exotic_Particles_in_High-Energy_Physics_with_Deep_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264890087_Torch7_A_Matlab-like_Environment_for_Machine_Learning"]}
