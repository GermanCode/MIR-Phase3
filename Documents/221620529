{"id":221620529,"title":"Bayesian Ensemble Learning.","authors":["Hugh A. Chipman","Edward I. George","Robert E. McCulloch"],"_abstract":"We develop a Bayesian \"sum-of-trees\" model, named BART, where each tree is constrained by a prior to be a weak learner. Fitting and inference are accomplished via an iterative backfitting MCMC algorithm. This model is motivated by ensem- ble methods in general, and boosting algorithms in particular. Like boosting, each weak learner (i.e., each weak tree) contributes a small amount to the overall model. However, our procedure is defined by a statistical model: a prior and a likelihood, while boosting is defined by an algorithm. This model-based approach enables a full and accurate assessment of uncertainty in model predictions, while remaining highly competitive in terms of predictive accuracy.","cited_in":[{"id":262085259,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262085259_Modeling_Heterogeneous_Treatment_Effects_in_Survey_Experiments_with_Bayesian_Additive_Regression_Trees"},{"id":233439846,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233439846_Challenges_With_Propensity_Score_Strategies_in_a_High-Dimensional_Setting_and_a_Potential_Alternative"},{"id":46495377,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46495377_Bayesian_flexible_modeling_of_trip_durations"},{"id":221259666,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221259666_Object_Class_Segmentation_using_Random_Forests"},{"id":238508738,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238508738_BAYESIAN_ADDITIVE_REGRESSION_KERNELS"},{"id":249808008,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249808008_A_Review_of_Heterogeneous_Ensemble_Methods"},{"id":257885097,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257885097_Algorithmic_criminology"},{"id":266472210,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266472210_Oxford-IIIT_TRECVID_2009_-_Notebook_Paper"},{"id":215990083,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215990083_Additive_Groves_of_Regression_Trees"},{"id":5299510,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5299510_Extracting_sequence_features_to_predict_protein_-_DNA_interactions_A_comparative_study"},{"id":221486199,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221486199_Context-dependent_additive_log_F_0_model_for_HMM-based_speech_synthesis"},{"id":26781808,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26781808_Profiling_Mass_Spectrometry_Proteomics_Data_Using_Smoothed_Nonlinear_Energy_Operator_and_Bayesian_Additive_Regression_Trees"},{"id":228127259,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228127259_Assessing_Consumer_Fraud_Risk_in_Insurance_Claims_An_Unsupervised_Learning_Technique_Using_Discrete_and_Continuous_Predictor_Variables"},{"id":258228792,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258228792_BART_Bayesian_additive_regression_trees"},{"id":42767996,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/42767996_Prediction_of_Polycomb_target_genes_in_mouse_embryonic_stem_cells"},{"id":45504789,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45504789_The_causal_dependence_of_present_plant_knowledge_on_herbals-Contemporary_medicinal_plant_use_in_Campania_Italy_compared_to_Matthioli_1568"},{"id":242997843,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242997843_Preserving_data_utility_via_BART"},{"id":225230303,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225230303_Statistical_Learning_and_Modeling_of_TF-DNA_Binding"},{"id":226076608,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226076608_Accurate_and_Simplified_Prediction_of_AVF_for_Delay_and_Energy_Efficient_Cache_Design"},{"id":235366946,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235366946_Adrenal_Gland_Abnormality_Detection_Using_Random_Forest_Classification"},{"id":257305866,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257305866_Assessing_lack_of_common_support_in_causal_inference_using_Bayesian_nonparametrics_Implications_for_evaluating_the_effect_of_breastfeeding_on_children's_cognitive_outcomes"},{"id":260117847,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260117847_Learning_Phenotype_Densities_Conditional_on_Many_Interacting_Predictors"},{"id":276073491,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276073491_A_Very_Simple_Safe-Bayesian_Random_Forest"}],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245582023_Bayesian_CART_-_Prior_Specification_and_Posterior_Simulation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236952762_Random_Forests","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234054499_Staged_Mixture_Modelling_and_Boosting","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245315755_Visualizable_and_interpretable_regression_models_with_good_prediction_power","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264955448_Least_Angle_Regression_with_discussion","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236588890_Bayesian_Nonparametric_Modeling_for_Causal_Inference","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221995973_A_decision-theoretic_generalization_of_on-line_learning_and_an_application_to_boosting","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2450683_Bayesian_CART_model_search","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241736141_Detection_of_Influential_Observation_in_Linear_Regression","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2670104_Reversible_Jum_Markov_Chain_Monte_Carlo_Computation_and_Bayesian_Model_Determination","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2237782_Bayesian_Backfitting","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2424824_Greedy_Function_Approximation_A_Gradient_Boosting_Machine","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2833559_Least_Angle_Regression","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274325288_Reversal_of_fortune_A_statistical_analysis_of_penalty_calls_in_the_National_Hockey_League","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/201841001_A_Decision-Theoretic_Generalization_of_On-L
