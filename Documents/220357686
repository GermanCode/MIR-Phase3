{"id":220357686,"title":"Centering Sequences with Bounded Differences","authors":["Colin McDiarmid"],"_abstract":"ABSTRACT Inequalities for martingales with bounded differences have recently proved to be very useful in combinatorics and in the mathematics of operational research and computer science. We see here that these inequalities extend in a natural way to with bounded differences, and thus include, for example, better inequalities for sequences related to sampling without replacement.","cited_in":[{"id":51955780,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51955780_The_Martingale_Approach_for_Concentration_and_Applications_inInformation_Theory_Communications_and_Coding"},{"id":51934759,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51934759_Transient_analysis_of_the_subordinated_chain_of_a_state_dependent_purebirth_process"},{"id":51934122,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51934122_A_stochastic_model_for_distributed_real_time_streaming_-_Evolution_ofthe_network_structure"},{"id":224132846,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224132846_The_Power_of_Convex_Relaxation_Near-Optimal_Matrix_Completion"},{"id":266354976,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266354976_Concentration"},{"id":47842826,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/47842826_Balls_and_Bins_A_Study_in_Negative_Dependence"},{"id":2319374,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2319374_Concentration_of_Measure_for_the_Analysis_of_Randomised_Algorithms"},{"id":2927391,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2927391_Improved_Algorithms_for_the_Random_Cluster_Graph_Model"},{"id":222664854,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222664854_Rigorous_Verification_Validation_Uncertainty_Quantification_and_Certification_Through_concentration-of-Measure_Inequalities"},{"id":220691205,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220691205_Concentration_of_Measure_for_the_Analysis_of_Randomized_Algorithms"},{"id":50382378,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/50382378_Uncertainty_Quantification_Via_Codimension-One_Partitioning"},{"id":221662859,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221662859_Optimal_Uncertainty_Quantification_for_Legacy_Data_Observations_of_Lipschitz_Functions"},{"id":256802214,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256802214_Rigorous_model-based_uncertainty_quantification_with_application_to_terminal_ballistics-Part_II_Systems_with_uncontrollable_inputs_and_large_scatter"},{"id":233937230,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233937230_Concentration_of_Measure_Inequalities_in_Information_Theory_Communications_and_Coding_Second_Edition"},{"id":234006578,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234006578_Concentration_of_Measure_Inequalities_in_Information_Theory_Communications_and_Coding"},{"id":234006558,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234006558_12124663v2"},{"id":256606492,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256606492_Concentration_inequalities_for_sampling_without_replacement"}],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23629875_Classes_of_Orderings_of_Measures_and_Related_Correlation_Inequalities-II_Multivariate_Reverse_Rule_Distributions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221996154_Probability_Inequalities_For_Sums_of_Bounded_Random_Variables","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220459353_The_Expected_Distribution_of_Degrees_in_Random_Binary_Search_Trees","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23632947_A_Concept_of_Negative_Dependence_Using_Stochastic_Ordering","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38361748_Some_Concepts_of_Negative_Dependence","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38358951_Negative_Association_of_Random_Variables_With_Applications","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222452792_The_analysis_of_a_fringe_heuristic_for_binary_search_trees","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/36343238_On_some_concepts_of_dependence","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220618365_Determining_the_Stability_Number_of_a_Graph","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220688500_The_Art_of_Computer_Programming_Volume_III_Sorting_and_Searching","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232992884_Multivariate_Negative_Dependence","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239061974_An_Introduction_to_Probability_Theory_and_Its_Applications_-_Volume_I_and_II","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220692294_Evolution_of_Random_Search_Trees","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239555018_The_tail_of_the_hypergeometric_distribution","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220695960_The_Probabilistic_Method","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/231903978_Two_Applications_of_Urn_Processes_The_Fringe_Analysis_of_Search_Trees_and_The_Simulation_of_Quasi-Stationary_Distributions_of_Markov_Chains"]}
