{"id":2469179,"title":"A Bayesian Analysis of Ordinal Data Using Mixtures","authors":["Alaattin Erkanli","Dalene Stangl","Peter Muller"],"_abstract":"this paper, we discuss a Bayesian method for the analysis of ordinal data. It is assumed that the ordinal data arise from an underlying latent variable which is related to a set of covariates in a generalized linear model sense. The link function which associates the class probabilities to the set of covariates is estimated as a finite mixture of probit links, thereby introducing flexibility in the choice of the link function. The Bayesian model provides an easy-to-implement simulation environment and therefore avoids pitfalls of the expensive and numerically unstable maximum likelihood analysis. The class probabilities are estimated by considering the predictive distribution of a future observation given the set of covariates. Computations are performed using Gibbs sampling. The method is illustrated by using both simulated and real data sets.","cited_in":[{"id":51403714,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51403714_Flexible_Random_Intercept_Models_for_Binary_Outcomes_Using_Mixtures_of_Normals"},{"id":2470994,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2470994_A_general_class_of_hierarchical_ordinal_regression_models_with_applications_to_correlated_ROC_analysis"},{"id":228623852,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228623852_Nonparametric_Bayesian_modeling_for_multivariate_ordinal_data"},{"id":2719888,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2719888_Computing_With_Priors_That_Support_Identifiable_Semiparametric_Models"},{"id":2663884,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2663884_Bayesian_Inference_for_Semiparametric_Binary_Regression"},{"id":2819359,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2819359_Bayesian_Semiparametric_Inference_for_the_Accelerated_Failure_Time_Model"},{"id":268649728,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268649728_Dirichlet_Process_Mixed_Generalized_Linear_Models"},{"id":2468788,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2468788_Estimating_Mixture_of_Dirichlet_Process_Models"},{"id":2469229,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2469229_Efficient_MCMC_Schemes_for_Robust_Model_Extensions_Using_Encompassing_Dirichlet_Process_Mixture_Models"},{"id":4746299,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4746299_Marginal_Likelihood_and_Bayes_Factors_for_Dirichlet_Process_Mixture_Models"},{"id":4746414,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4746414_Cross-Calibration_of_Stroke_Disability_Measures_Bayesian_Analysis_of_Longitudinal_Ordinal_Categorical_Data_Using_Negative_Dependence"},{"id":238879865,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238879865_Cross-Calibration_of_Stroke_Disability_Measures"},{"id":228806505,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228806505_Nonparametric_Bayesian_Modeling_for_Multivariate_Ordinal_Data"},{"id":7356774,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7356774_Bayesian_semi-parametric_ROC_analysis"}],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38359123_The_Analysis_of_Cross-Classified_Data_Having_Ordered_andor_Unordered_Categories_Association_Models_Correlation_Models_and_Asymmetry_Models_for_Contingency_Tables_With_or_Without_Missing_Entries","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38357862_Antoniak_CE_Mixtures_of_Dirichlet_Processes_with_Applications_to_Bayesian_Nonparametric_Problems_Ann_Stat_2_1152-1174","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223706475_Maximum_likelihood_methods_for_linear_and_log-linear_models_in_categorical_data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/21244246_A_Monte_Carlo_Method_for_Bayesian_Inference_in_Frailty_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230663734_Analysis_of_Ordinal_Categorical_Variables","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224910629_Sampling-Based_Approaches_to_Calculate_Marginal_Densities","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38357634_A_Bayesian_Analysis_of_Some_Non-Parametric_Problems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256557498_Bayesian_Analysis_of_Dichotomous_Quantal_Response_Models"]}
