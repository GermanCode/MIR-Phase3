{"id":275054882,"title":"Linear Maximum Margin Classifier for Learning from Uncertain Data","authors":["Christos Tzelepis","Vasileios Mezaris","Ioannis Patras"],"_abstract":"ABSTRACT In this paper, we propose a maximum margin classifier that deals with uncertainty in data input. Specifically, we reformulate the SVM framework such that each input training entity is not solely a feature vector representation, but a multi-dimensional Gaussian distribution with given probability density, i.e., with a given mean and covariance matrix. The latter expresses the uncertainty. We arrive at a convex optimization problem, which is solved in the primal form using a gradient descent approach. The resulting classifier, which we name SVM with Gaussian Sample Uncertainty (SVM-GSU), is tested on synthetic data, as well as on the problem of event detection in video using the large-scale TRECVID MED 2014 dataset, and the problem of image classification using the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed classifier.","cited_in":[],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2376111_A_Training_Algorithm_for_Optimal_Margin_Classifier","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239595717_Theory_of_Pattern_Recognition_In_Russian","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225171987_Rademacher_and_Gaussian_Complexities_Risk_Bounds_and_Structural_Results","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221618660_Support_Vector_Classification_with_Input_Data_Uncertainty","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2397180_Second-Order_Cone_Programming","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228684804_Robust_Convex_Optimization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/47536103_Theory_and_Applications_of_Robust_Optimization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2834016_A_Robust_Minimax_Approach_to_Classification","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/38366532_Multivariate_Chebyshev_Inequalities","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234768764_Second_Order_Cone_Programming_Approaches_for_Handling_Missing_and_Uncertain_Data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221617885_A_Second_Order_Cone_programming_Formulation_for_Classifying_Missing_Data","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/1741729_Robustness_and_Regularization_of_Support_Vector_Machines","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45917363_Robustness_and_Generalization","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256822654_Robust_twin_support_vector_machine_for_pattern_classification_Pattern_Recognit","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2929472_A_Framework_for_Robust_Subspace_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259965482_Efficient_Online_Subspace_Learning_With_an_Indefinite_Kernel_for_Visual_Tracking_and_Recognition","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26855944_Uncorrelated_Multilinear_Principal_Component_Analysis_for_Unsupervised_Multilinear_Subspace_Learning","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7213763_Modulated_Hebb-Oja_Learning_Rule-A_Method_for_Principal_Subspace_Analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320285_The_Entire_Regularization_Path_for_the_Support_Vector_Machine","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226658534_A_Tutorial_on_Support_Vector_Machines_for_Pattern_Recognition","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243083316_The_Convergence_of_a_Class_of_Double-Rank_Minimization_Algorithms","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228715647_LIBSVM_A_library_for_support_vector_machines","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220784058_TRECVID_2010_-_An_Overview_of_the_Goals_Tasks_Data_Evaluation_Mechanisms_and_Metrics","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221301350_A_new_interpretation_of_average_precision","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260353955_Mixture_Subclass_Discriminant_Analysis_Link_to_Restricted_Gaussian_Model_and_Other_Generalizations","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220279590_Regularized_Kernel_Discriminant_Analysis_With_a_Robust_Kernel_for_Face_Recognition_and_Verification","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24061088_Note_on_the_Sampling_Error_of_the_Difference_Between_Correlated_Proportions_or_Percentages","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247931959_The_mnist_database_of_handwritten_digits","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262203716_Nested_Sequential_Minimal_Optimization_for_Support_Vector_Machines"]}
