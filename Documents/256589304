{"id":256589304,"title":"Unsupervised Track Classification Based on Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes","authors":["JÃ¼ri Sildam","Paolo Braca","Kevin D Lepage","P. Willett"],"_abstract":"ABSTRACT An unsupervised track classification approach is applied to sonar multistatic multitarget tracking. Appropriate discriminative and aggregative features are derived from beamformed and normalized matched-filtered data as recorded from a linear array towed behind an AUV. A clustering algorithm based on Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes is proposed for unsupervised classification of tracks. Overall improvement of target tracking is demonstrated via the Optimal Subpattern Assignment metric.","cited_in":[{"id":268503436,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268503436_Single-snapshot_DOA_estimation_by_using_Compressed_Sensing_JASP"}],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230705191_SUPERVISED_TRACK_CLASSIFICATION_IN_SUPPORT_OF_AUV_DECISION_MAKING","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3320950_A_Consistent_Metric_for_Performance_Evaluation_of_Multi-Object_Filters","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224980705_A_Kernel_Two-Sample_Test","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/50402324_Hilbert_Space_Embeddings_and_Metrics_on_Probability_Measures","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221620547_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4742259_Hierarchical_Dirichlet_Processes","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229100417_A_Constructive_Definition_of_the_Dirichlet_Prior","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230888378_Supervised_Track_Classification_in_Support_of_AUV_Decision_Making","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/244954555_A_constructive_de_nition_of_Dirichlet_priors","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221345210_Beam_sampling_for_the_infinite_hidden_Markov_model"]}
