{"id":243771025,"title":"Ensemble learning in Bayesian neural networks","authors":["David Barber","Christopher M. Bishop"],"_abstract":"Bayesian treatments of learning in neural networks are typically based either on a local Gaussian approximation to a mode of the posterior weight distribution, or on Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations. A third approach, called `ensemble learning', was introduced by Hinton (1993). It aims to approximate the posterior distribution by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true posterior and a parametric approximating distribution. The original derivation of a deterministic algorithm relied on the use of a Gaussian approximating distribution with a diagonal covariance matrix and hence was unable to capture the posterior correlations between parameters. In this chapter we show how the ensemble learning approach can be extended to full-covariance Gaussian distributions while remaining computationally tractable. We also extend the framework to deal with hyperparameters, leading to a simple re-estimation procedure. One of the benefits of our approach is that it yields a strict lower bound on the marginal likelihood, in contrast to other approximate procedures.","cited_in":[{"id":277959252,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277959252_Bayesian_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_with_Bernoulli_Approximate_Variational_Inference"},{"id":51893586,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51893586_Variational_Cumulant_Expansions_for_Intractable_Distributions"},{"id":220320406,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320406_Building_Blocks_for_Variational_Bayesian_Learning_of_Latent_Variable_Models"},{"id":222578147,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222578147_Hierarchical_Models_of_Variance_Sources"},{"id":2925047,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2925047_Missing_Values_In_Hierarchical_Nonlinear_Factor_Analysis"},{"id":2899371,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2899371_Nonlinear_Independent_Factor_Analysis_By_Hierarchical"},{"id":2566439,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2566439_An_Unsupervised_Ensemble_Learning_Method_for_Nonlinear_Dynamic_State-Space_Models"},{"id":11994835,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11994835_Bayesian_approach_for_neural_networks_-_Review_and_case_studies"},{"id":243601128,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243601128_NONLINEAR_INDEPENDENT_FACTOR_ANALYSIS_BY_HIERARCHICAL_MODELS"},{"id":27516514,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/27516514_Bayesian_Inference_in_Nonlinear_and_Relational_Latent_Variable_Models"},{"id":239579683,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239579683_Technical_report_on_Bayesian_methods"},{"id":266463701,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266463701_Bayesian_Methods_for_Supervised_Neural_Networks"},{"id":2592693,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2592693_Bayesian_Methods_-_Computer_Practical"},{"id":228610669,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228610669_Variational_Learning_in_Graphical_Models_and_Neural_Networks"},{"id":2579651,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2579651_A_Variational_Bayesian_Committee_of_Neural_Networks"},{"id":3873450,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3873450_Nonlinear_Source_Separation_Using_Ensemble_Learning_and_MLP_Networks"},{"id":228381296,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228381296_Variational_inference_in_probabilistic_models"},{"id":27515978,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/27515978_Bayesian_Model_Assessment_and_Selection_Using_Expected_Utilities"},{"id":3906864,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3906864_Nonlinear_Static_and_Dynamic_Blind_Source_Separation_Using_Ensemble_Learning"},{"id":225170772,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225170772_A_Comparison_of_State-of-the-Art_Classification_Techniques_with_Application_to_Cytogenetics"},{"id":2378249,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2378249_Missing_Values_In_Nonlinear_Factor_Analysis"},{"id":40498273,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/40498273_Gaussian_Processes_-_Iterative_Sparse_Approximations"},{"id":4117100,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4117100_Partially_observed_values"},{"id":47529441,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/47529441_Continuous_Reinforced_Snap-Drift_Learning_in_a_Neural_Architecture_for_Proxylet_Selection_in_Active_Computer_Networks"},{"id":4207585,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4207585_Agent-based_personal_article_citation_assistant"},{"id":220699413,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220699413_Expectation_Propagation_for_Rating_Players_in_Sports_Competitions"},{"id":220659559,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220659559_A_Study_on_Smoothing_for_Particle-Filtered_3D_Human_Body_Tracking"},{"id":264660107,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264660107_Neural_networks"},{"id":222575714,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222575714_Multi-task_preference_learning_with_an_application_to_hearing_aid_personalization"},{"id":220963826,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220963826_Mining_Latent_Sources_of_Causal_Time_Series_Using_Nonlinear_State_Space_Modeling"},{"id":269053871,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269053871_An_Evolutionary_Ensemble_that_Learns_the_Spectroscopic_Characteristics_of_Scintillation_and_CZT_Detectors"},{"id":277959098,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277959098_Dropout_as_a_Bayesian_Approximation_Representing_Model_Uncertainty_in_Deep_Learning"}],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221620114_Radial_Basis_Functions_A_Bayesian_Treatment","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2280218_Keeping_Neural_Networks_Simple_by_Minimizing_the_Description_Length_of_the_Weights","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/33020867_An_Introduction_to_Variational_Methods_for_Graphical_Models","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/30771436_MacKay_DJC_A_Practical_Bayesian_Framework_for_Backprop_Networks_Neural_Computation_43_448-472","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2822332_Fast_Exact_Mu
