{"id":283755725,"title":"Non-volatile memory as hardware synapse in neuromorphic computing: A first look at reliability issues","authors":["R.M. Shelby","Geoffrey Burr","Irem Boybat","C. Di Nolfo"],"_abstract":"A large-scale artificial neural network, a three-layer perceptron, is implemented using two phase-change memory (PCM) devices to encode the weight of each of 164,885 synapses. The PCM conductances are programmed using a crossbar-compatible pulse scheme, and the network is trained to recognize a 5000-example subset of the MNIST handwritten digit database, achieving 82.2% accuracy during training and 82.9% generalization accuracy on unseen test examples. A simulation of the network performance is developed that incorporates a statistical model of the PCM response, allowing quantitative estimation of the tolerance of the network to device variation, defects, and conductance response.","cited_in":[],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258793648_Immunity_to_Device_Variations_in_a_Spiking_Neural_Network_With_Memristive_Nanodevices","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4277832_Novel_Lithography-Independent_Pore_Phase_Change_Memory","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224241025_An_Electronic_Synapse_Device_Based_on_Metal_Oxide_Resistive_Switching_Memory_for_Neuromorphic_Computation","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257973238_Physical_aspects_of_low_power_synapses_based_on_phase_change_memory_devices","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224267942_Phase_Change_Memory_as_Synapse_for_Ultra-Dense_Neuromorphic_Systems_Application_to_Complex_Visual_Pattern_Extraction","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229091480_Learning_Representations_by_Back_Propagating_Errors","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2985446_Gradient-based_learning_applied_to_document_recognition_Proc_IEEE","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262767954_Experimental_Demonstration_of_Array-level_Learning_with_Phase_Change_Synaptic_Devices","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247931959_The_mnist_database_of_handwritten_digits","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41654373_Nanoscale_Memristor_Device_as_Synapse_in_Neuromorphic_Systems","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260365035_Sub-30nm_scaling_and_high-speed_operation_of_fully-confined_Access-Devices_for_3D_crosspoint_memory_based_on_Mixed-Ionic-Electronic-Conduction_MIEC_Materials","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228642383_Self-Organized_computation_with_unreliable_memristive_nandevices_Nanotechnology","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264630187_ARTIFICIAL_BRAINS_A_million_spiking-neuron_integrated_circuit_with_a_scalable_communication_network_and_interface","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256377858_Synaptic_electronics_Materials_devices_and_applications","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282551767_Experimental_Demonstration_and_Tolerancing_of_a_Large-Scale_Neural_Network_165_000_Synapses_Using_Phase-Change_Memory_as_the_Synaptic_Weight_Element","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224478642_Neural_Networks_and_Their_Applications","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262321025_Nanoscale_Electronic_Synapses_Using_Phase_Change_Devices"]}
