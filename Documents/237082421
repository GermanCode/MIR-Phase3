{"id":237082421,"title":"Emotional Expression Classification Using Time-Series Kernels","authors":["András Lörincz","László A Jeni","Zoltan Szabo","Jeffrey F Cohn","Takeo Kanade"],"_abstract":"Recent advances in kernel methods are very promising for improving the estimation, clustering and classification of spatio-temporal processes. Facial expression estimation can take advantage of such methods if one considers marker positions and their motion in 3D space. We applied support vector classification with kernels derived from dynamic time-warping similarity measures. We achieved excellent results using only the 'motion pattern' of the PCA compressed representation of the marker point vector, the socalled shape parameters. Beyond the classification of full motion patterns, the classification of the initial phase of an emotion (i) is competitive with methods relying on textural information and (ii) has complementary advantages to texture based algorithms reinforcing the need for mixed approaches.","cited_in":[{"id":281576403,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281576403_Learning_Temporal_Alignment_Uncertainty_for_Efficient_Event_Detection"},{"id":277312235,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277312235_Ensemble_of_Hankel_Matrices_for_Face_Emotion_Recognition"},{"id":271503454,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271503454_12"},{"id":264249059,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264249059_LabelMovie_Semi-supervised_Machine_Annotation_Tool_with_Quality_Assurance_and_Crowd-sourcing_Options_for_Videos"},{"id":270669788,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270669788_Frame-Based_Facial_Expression_Recognition_Using_Geometrical_Features"},{"id":271430307,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271430307_Facial_expression_recognition_using_constrained_local_models_and_Hidden_Markov_models_with_consciousness-based_architecture"},{"id":264120989,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264120989_Spatio-temporal_Event_Classification_Using_Time-Series_Kernel_Based_Structured_Sparsity"},{"id":282158094,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282158094_Action_Recognition_by_using_kernels_on_aclets_sequences"},{"id":270650763,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270650763_A_Generative_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machine_Based_Method_for_High-Dimensional_Motion_Data_Modeling"},{"id":282463942,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282463942_Facial_Expression_Classification_Using_Artificial_Neural_Network_and_K-Nearest_Neighbor"},{"id":276091417,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276091417_Multimodal_learning_for_facial_expression_recognition"},{"id":277311895,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277311895_Using_Hankel_Matrices_for_Dynamics-based_Facial_Emotion_Recognition_and_Pain_Detection"},{"id":282598714,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282598714_A_Spatio-temporal_RBM-based_Model_for_Facial_Expression_Recognition"}],"reference":["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221292140_Comprehensive_Database_for_Facial_Expression_Analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2900541_Active_appearance_models_revisited_IJCV_602_135-164","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51078614_Switching_processes_in_financial_markets","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241770605_Searching_and_mining_trillions_of_time_series_subsequences_under_dynamic_time_warping","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220660258_Deformable_Model_Fitting_by_Regularized_Landmark_Mean-Shift","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222399376_Boosting_encoded_dynamic_features_for_facial_expression_recognition_Pattern_Recogn_Lett_30_132-139","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4248854_A_Kernel_for_Time_Series_Based_on_Global_Alignments","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230554292_3D_Shape_Estimation_in_Video_Sequences_Provides_High_Precision_Evaluation_of_Facial_Expressions","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221112030_Combined_Support_Vector_Machines_and_Hidden_Markov_Models_for_Modeling_Facial_Action_Temporal_Dynamics","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221113976_Lecture_Notes_in_Computer_Science","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225118046_Predicting_Time_Series_with_Support_Vector_Machines","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2839645_Computing_the_Nearest_Correlation_Matrix_-_a_Problem_From_Finance","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224165251_Facial_Expression_Recognition_Using_Gabor_Motion_Energy_Filters","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257351937_Learning_spatiotemporal_features_by_using_independent_component_analysis_with_application_to_facial_expression_recognition","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224165246_The_Extended_Cohn-Kanade_Dataset_CK_A_complete_dataset_for_action_unit_and_emotion-specified_expression","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260353896_Infinite_Hidden_Conditional_Random_Fields_for_Human_Behavior_Analysis","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224238096_Modeling_hidden_dynamics_of_multimodal_cues_for_spontaneous_agreement_and_disagreement_recognition","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259714804_Continuous_AU_Intensity_Estimation_using_Localized_Sparse_Facial_Feature_Space","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228715647_LIBSVM_A_library_for_support_vector_machines","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221345459_Fast_Global_Alignment_Kernels","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4378081_Discrete-Time_Processing_of_Speech_Signals_MacMillan_Pub","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3176441_Dynamic_Programming_Algorithm_Optimization_for_Spoken_Word_Recognition","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3845529_Comprehesive_database_for_facial_expression_analysis"]}
