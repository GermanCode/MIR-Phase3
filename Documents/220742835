{"id":220742835,"title":"Constrained Multi-objective Optimization Using Steady State Genetic Algorithms","authors":["Deepti Chafekar","Jiang Xuan","Khaled Rasheed"],"_abstract":"In this paper we propose two novel approaches for solving constrained multi-objective optimization problems using steady state GAs. These methods are intended for solving real-world application problems that have many constraints and very small feasible regions. One method called Objective Exchange Genetic Algorithm for Design Optimization (OEGADO) runs several GAs concurrently with each GA optimizing one objective and exchanging information about its objective with the others. The other method called Objective Switching Genetic Algorithm for Design Optimization (OSGADO) runs each objective sequentially with a common population for all objectives. Empirical results in benchmark and engineering design domains are presented. A comparison between our methods and Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) shows that our methods performed better than NSGA-II for difficult problems and found Pareto-optimal solutions in fewer objective evaluations. The results suggest that our methods are better applicable for solving real-world application problems wherein the objective computation time is large.","cited_in":[{"id":263779142,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263779142_Constrained_Multiobjective_Biogeography_Optimization_Algorithm"},{"id":224246932,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224246932_Asynchronous_Evolutionary_Multi-Objective_Algorithms_with_heterogeneous_evaluation_costs"},{"id":229344627,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229344627_Multi-objective_evolutionary_simulation-optimisation_of_a_real-world_manufacturing_problem"},{"id":224330154,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224330154_A_Parallel_Surrogate-Assisted_Multi-Objective_Evolutionary_Algorithm_for_Computationally_Expensive_Optimization_Problems"},{"id":220949396,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220949396_Parallel_Genetic_Algorithm_for_Search_and_Constrained_Multi-Objective_Optimization"},{"id":221001480,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221001480_Using_a_genetic_algorithm_to_optimize_the_gape_of_a_snake_jaw"},{"id":237630671,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237630671_SEARCHING_FOR_PRESCRIPTIVE_TREATMENT_SCHEDULES_WITH_A_GENETIC_ALGORITHM_A_TOOL_FOR_FOREST_MANAGEMENT"},{"id":242286565,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242286565_EDITORIAL_BOARDS_PUBLISHING_COUNCIL"},{"id":265401796,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265401796_MULTIOBJECTIVE_PARTICLE_SWARM_OPTIMIZATION_INTEGRATION_OF_DYNAMIC_POPULATION_AND_MULTIPLE-SWARM_CONCEPTS_AND_CONSTRAINT_HANDLING"},{"id":228854616,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228854616_Evolutionary_Balancing_of_Healthy_Meals"},{"id":4095307,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4095307_A_novel_multiobjective_particle_swarm_optimization_for_buoys-arrangement_design"},{"id":220180305,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220180305_Cross-pollinating_parallel_genetic_algorithms_for_multiobjective_search_and_optimization"},{"id":220998211,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220998211_Polygonal_Approximation_of_Digital_Curves_Using_a_Multi-objective_Genetic_Algorithm"},{"id":228931731,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228931731_Multi-objective_evolutionary_algorithm_for_investigating_the_trade-off_between_pleiotropy_and_redundancy_-_art_no_60390Q"},{"id":229902910,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229902910_Measuring_and_optimizing_systems'_quality_costs_and_project_duration"},{"id":40436966,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/40436966_Approximation_of_Digital_Curves_using_a_Multi-Objective_Genetic_Algorithm"},{"id":43606112,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/43606112_Approximation_de_courbes_par_Algorithme_Genetique_Multi-Objectif"},{"id":222080176,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222080176_IT-CEMOP_An_iterative_co-evolutionary_algorithm_for_multiobjective_optimization_problem_with_nonlinear_constraints"},{"id":221006844,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221006844_Constraint_handling_in_multi-objective_evolutionary_optimization"},{"id":222555407,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222555407_Optimisation_of_business_process_designs_an_algorithmic_approach_with_multiple_objectives_International_Journal_of_Production_Economics_1091-2105-121"},{"id":4280117,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4280117_Reinforcement_Learning_and_Dynamic_Planning_Applied_to_Virtual_Humans_Animation"},{"id":221185153,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221185153_Memetic_Algorithm_Based_on_a_Constraint_Satisfaction_Technique_for_VRPTW"},{"id":224347477,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224347477_Multi-objective_order_planning_model_and_algorithm_for_integrated_steel_production"},{"id":222168694,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222168694_Artificial_immune_system_for_multi-objective_design_optimization_of_composite_structures"},{"id":221547241,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221547241_Reference_Point-Based_Particle_Swarm_Optimization_Using_a_Steady-State_Approach"},{"id":221228592,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221228592_On_the_Effect_of_the_Steady-State_Selection_Scheme_in_Multi-Objective_Genetic_Algorithms"},{"id":225747680,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225747680_On_the_Effect_of_Applying_a_Steady-State_Selection_Scheme_in_the_Multi-Objective_Genetic_Algorithm_NSGA-II"},{"id":226755891,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226755891_An_Adaptive_Penalty_Function_for_Handling_Constraint_in_Multi-objective_Evolutionary_Optimization"},{"id":224393743,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224393743_Constraint_Handling_in_Multiobjective_Evolutionary_Optimization"},{"id":221006389,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221006389_Constraint_handling_procedure_for_multiobjective_particle_swarm_optimization"},{"id":232409813,"url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232409813_Artificial_immune_system_based_neural_networks_for_solving_multi-object
